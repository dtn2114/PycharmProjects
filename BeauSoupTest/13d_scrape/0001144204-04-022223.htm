                  attached hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

Item 3.     Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.

            On December 9, 2004, Xechem International, Inc., William Pursley,
            and CepTor Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and the wholly owned
            subsidiary of Xechem, entered into the Second Amendment to the
            CepTor Agreement Second Amendment.

                  The parties entered into the original CepTor Agreement on
            March 31, 2004, in order to provide a mechanism, for among other
            things, facilitating the independent financing of CepTor and a means
            of liquidity for Xechem.


<PAGE>

            The parties entered into the Second Amendment as part of a merger.
            Medallion Crest Management, Inc., a Florida corporation, CepTor and
            CepTor Acquisition Corp., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned
            subsidiary of Medallion ("Acquisition Corp.") entered into an
            Agreement of Merger and Plan of Reorganization, pursuant to which
            CepTor merged with and into Acquisition Corp, with CepTor surviving
            as the wholly owned subsidiary of Medallion. Pursuant to the Merger
            Agreement, Medallion acquired all of the outstanding capital stock
            of CepTor in exchange for issuing shares of Medallion's common
            stock, par value $0.0001 per share to CepTor's shareholders at a
            ratio of 2.165674 shares of Medallion common stock for each share of
            CepTor common stock outstanding at the effective time of the Merger,
            and assumed certain obligations of CepTor to holders of its
            outstanding indebtedness and others. As a result, the former
            shareholders of CepTor became shareholders of Medallion, and
            Medallion changed its corporate name to CepTor Corporation
            ("Medallion/CepTor").

            Xechem was the record holder of 1,800,000 issued and outstanding
            shares of common stock of CepTor, which following the Merger
            converted into 3,898,213 shares of Medallion common stock.

            As a condition to closing of the Merger Agreement, concurrently with
            the closing of the Merger, Medallion/CepTor sold to subscribers
            103.62 units (the "Offering"), pursuant to a private offering which
            is described in a Confidential Private Placement Memorandum of
            Medallion/CepTor, dated October 22, 2004, as supplemented November
            16, 2004 (the "PPM").

            The CepTor Agreement provided for a put obligation with respect to
            the capital raised through the Offering (the "Put"). The number of
            shares of CepTor to be put by Xechem pursuant to the Put shall be
            that amount of shares equal to the quotient of: (a) twenty-five
            percent (25%) of the gross cash raised (before any commissions or
            other expenses) in each tranche of equity financing, divided by (b)
            the price per share of Medallion common stock, at which such equity
            tranche is raised. The Second Amendment revised the Put percent to
            ten percent (10%) pursuant to the requirement of the placement agent
            of the Offering. Under the terms of the PPM, Medallion/CepTor was
            raising a minimum of $2.5 million and a maximum of $6.0 million from
            the offering of Units, subject to an over-allotment option
            ($900,000). Each Unit consisted of one share of Series A Convertible
            Preferred Stock and a warrant for 5,000 shares of Medallion/CepTor
            common stock, exercisable at $2.50 per share. Units were offered by
            the placement agent for sale at $25,000 per Unit. Shares of Series A
            Convertible Preferred Stock were convertible into 10,000 shares of
            Medallion/CepTor common stock.

            Therefore, under the PPM, assuming gross Offering proceeds of $2.5
            million from the sale of 100 Units, the Company would exercise its
            Put for $250,000 in cancellation of 100,000 shares ($2,500,000 x .10
            = $250,000/$2.50 = 100,000); and assuming gross proceeds of $6
            million from the sale of 240 Units, the Company would exercise its
            Put for $600,000 in cancellation of 240,000 shares ($6,000,000 x .10
            = $600,000/$2.50 = 240,000). In no event, may one or more exercises
            of the Put result in any amount in excess of $2.0 million being
            redeemed by Medallion/CepTor.

            Medallion/CepTor sold $2,590,500 or 103.62 Units pursuant to an
            initial closing of the Offering. Therefore, according to the terms
            of the Second Amendment, Xechem Put and Medallion/CepTor redeemed
            103,620 shares of its Medallion/CepTor stock at $2.50 per share for
            a total consideration of $259,050 ($2,590,500 x .10 = $259,050/$2.50
            = 103,620). Following the Put/redemption, Xechem currently owns
            3,794,593 shares of Medallion/CepTor stock.


<PAGE>

            Each further tranche for shares of equity to be sold by
            Medallion/CepTor subsequent to the Offering will result in the
            exercise of the Put by the Company, and shall be priced at the issue
            price per share for the tranche of equity corresponding to the Put
            to the greatest extent that is consistent with the principles
            identified herein. Xechem's Put (and Medallion/CepTor's redemption
            obligation) will cease once Xechem has put $2.0 million, in the
            aggregate to Medallion/CepTor.

            Pursuant to the terms of the CepTor Agreements, Xechem shall
            continue to be entitled to the royalty of two percent (2%) of gross
            revenues received by Medallion/CepTor with respect to the sale or
            licensing of products incorporating any of the CepTor intellectual
            property owned by CepTor on the effective date of the CepTor
            Agreement.

                  Finally, the shares of Medallion/CepTor common stock issued to
            Xechem pursuant to the Merger after giving effect to the Put (the
            "Company Common Stock") are subject to a lock-up agreement amongst
            the parties to the Second Amendment as follows: the Xechem will not
            sell its Company Common Stock for a period of six months following
            the effective date of the registration of the securities sold
            through the Offering; thereafter, Xechem may sell an amount equal to
            up to fifty percent (50%) of the Company Common Stock until the
            first anniversary of the effective date of the registration, at
            which time Xechem will be free to sell all its shares of Company
            Common Stock. If the shares of Medallion/CepTor common stock issued
            pursuant to the Offering are not registered within six months
            following the termination of the Offering, then the Company Common
            Stock shall be under a lock up agreement for a period of one year
            following the termination of the Offering, at which time Xechem may
            sell up to fifty percent (50%) of its Company Common Stock, with the
            ability to sell all of its Company Common Stock eighteen months
            following the termination of the Offering.

            The descriptions of the Merger, the Merger Agreement, the CepTor
            Agreement, and the Second Amendment included in this draft are not
            complete, and are qualified in their entirety by reference to the
            appropriate documents which are filed as Exhibits and are
            incorporated herein by reference.

Item 4.     Purpose of Transaction.

            See the response to Item 3.

            After the Initial Closing, the Issuer had outstanding 10,310,011
            shares of common stock, 103.62 shares of preferred stock
            (convertible into 1,036,200 shares of common stock), warrants to
            purchase 518,100 shares of common stock issued in the Offering, and
            additional warrants or options to purchase 901,089 shares of common
            stock. After giving effect to the Merger, the Offering, and the
            surrender of 3,315,500 shares of common stock, 1,850,000 shares of
            common stock constitute the freely-tradeable shares or "public
            float" of CepTor. Shares of the CepTor's common stock were approved
            for trading under the symbol (CEPO.OB) on the Over the Counter (OTC)
            Bulletin Board Market commencing on December 13, 2004.

            Lock-up Agreements. Shares of common stock issued pursuant to the
            Merger are subject to various lock-up agreements that provide
            restrictions on the future sale of common stock by certain holders.
            These lock-up agreements provide, in general, as follows: Xechem,
            the controlling stockholder of CepTor prior to the Merger and owner
            of approximately 34% of the voting securities of the CepTor
            following the Initial Closing (27% on a fully-diluted basis) may not
            sell any of its shares for a period of six months following the
            effective date of registration of shares purchased in the Offering
            and may only sell up to 50% percent thereafter until one-year
            following registration; and shares held by the participants in the
            Founders' Stock Plan who own approximately 27% of the voting
            securities of CepTor, collectively, following the Initial Closing


<PAGE>

            (21% on a fully-diluted basis) may only sell 10% of such shares
            immediately, 10% on the six month anniversary following issuance,
            and the balance upon initiation of a Phase III clinical trial for
            CepTor's "Myodor" technology for muscular dystrophy, unless
            accelerated by the CepTor's Compensation Committee or board of
            directors. All lock-up agreements expire 24 months after the Closing
            Date.

            Registration Statement. CepTor agreed to file a "resale"
            registration statement with the SEC on or before February 6, 2005,
            covering all shares of common stock underlying the preferred stock
            and underlying the warrants (including shares of common stock and
            underlying warrants issued to the Placement Agent in the Offering)
            and all shares of common stock issued to the Placement Agent. CepTor
            has agreed that it will maintain the effectiveness of the "resale"
            registration statement until December 7, 2005, after which time
            exempt sales pursuant to Rule 144 may be permitted. CepTor will use
            its best efforts to respond to any SEC comments to the "resale"
            registration statement on or prior to the date which is 20 business
            days from the date such comments are received, but in any event not
            later than 30 business days from the date such comments are
            received. The Company has agreed to use its best efforts to have
            such "resale" registration statement declared effective by the SEC
            as soon as possible after the initial filing date.

            If CepTor fails to (i) file the Registration Statement with the SEC
            on or prior to the date that is 180 days after the Closing Date, or
            (ii) respond to any SEC comments to the Registration Statement on or
            prior to the date which is 20 days after the date such comments are
            received, then CepTor shall be obligated to issue to purchasers of
            Units additional shares of common stock computed as follows: on the
            first day that CepTor has failed to file, or has failed to respond
            to SEC comments concerning the Registration Statement, as the case
            may be, CepTor shall issue to the purchasers of Units shares of
            common stock equal to 2% percent of the number of shares of common
            stock involved in such failure to file or respond, and an additional
            2% upon the expiration of each 30 day period following the initial
            failure, provided that all penalty shares shall be excluded from the
            determination, up to a maximum of 12%.

            CepTor will offer additional "piggy-back" registration to certain
            additional holders of common stock and may file separate
            registration statements for common stock issued to Xechem, under the
            Founders' Stock Plan, under the 2004 Incentive Plan, and for certain
            other holders.

            Changes Resulting From the Merger. CepTor (formerly known as
            Medallion Crest Management, Inc. intends to carry on CepTor's
            business as its sole line of business. CepTor is based in Hunt
            Valley, Maryland and is a development-stage bio-pharmaceutical
            company focusing on therapeutic products for neuromuscular and
            neurodegenerative diseases. Medallion/CepTor has relocated its
            principal executive offices to those of CepTor at 200 International
            Circle, Suite 5100, Hunt Valley, MD 21030.

            On December 2, 2004, a majority of the outstanding shares of the
            common stock of Medallion agreed, by written consent in lieu of a
            meeting and without the need to solicit votes, pending completion of
            the Merger to, among other things:

                  --change the corporate name from Medallion Crest Management,
            Inc. to CepTor Corporation in the state of Florida and elsewhere
            where Medallion/CepTor shall continue to conduct its business upon
            effectiveness of the Merger;

                  --authorize issuance of the preferred stock;


<PAGE>

                  --assume CepTor's Founders' Stock Plan and 2004 Incentive
            Stock Plan, and all related actions taken by the Board of CepTor
            prior to closing, which plans Medallion assumed in connection with
            the Merger; and

                  --appoint William Pursley (an approximately 19.6% shareholder
            of Xechem and Leonard Mudry (a former director of Xechem), both of
            whom were directors of CepTor as the directors of Medallion/CepTor.

            On December 7, 2004, a majority of the board of directors of
            Medallion approved resolutions by written consent to, among other
            things:

                  --authorize the Merger and Offering; and

                  --assume CepTor's outstanding indebtedness by Medallion and
            issuance of new indebtedness convertible at $1.25 per share into
            common stock pursuant to the Merger.

            On December 9, 2004, a majority of the board of directors of
            Medallion approved resolutions by written consent to, among other
            things:

                  --reserve for future issuance shares of common stock
            sufficient to effect the conversion of all preferred stock,
            warrants, options, and convertible indebtedness;

                  --authorize the further merger of Medallion and CepTor to
            change the domicile of Medallion to Delaware and collapse the
            parent-subsidiary relationship of Medallion and CepTor; and

                  --register under the Securities Acts all applicable shares;
            and

                  --take such other action as is necessary or appropriate to
            consummate the transactions consisting of the Merger, the Offering,
            and related transactions.

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of each of Acquisition Corp., Parent and

conditions set forth herein;

      WHEREAS, the Board of Directors of Acquisition Corp. and the Board of
Directors of the Company have approved the Merger in accordance with the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (the "DGCL"), and upon the terms and
subject to the conditions set forth herein and in the Certificate of Merger (the

      WHEREAS, simultaneously with the Closing (as such term is defined herein),

1. The Merger.

1.1 Merger. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement and the
Certificate of Merger, the Company shall be merged with and into Acquisition
Corp. in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. At the Effective Time (as
hereinafter defined), the separate legal existence of Acquisition Corp. shall
cease, and the Company shall be the surviving corporation in the Merger
(sometimes hereinafter referred to as the "Surviving Corporation") and shall
continue its corporate existence under the laws of the State of Delaware under
the name CepTor Corporation.

1.2 Effective Time. The Merger shall become effective on the date and at the
time the Certificate of Merger is filed with the Secretary of State of the State
of Delaware in accordance with Section 251 of the DGCL. The time at which the
Merger shall become effective as aforesaid is referred to hereinafter as the
"Effective Time," and the filing of the Certificate of Merger as set forth in
the first sentence of this Section 1.2 shall occur concurrently with the release
of the proceeds from the Private Placement to the Parent.

1.3     Certificate of Incorporation, By-laws, Directors and Officers.

(a) The Certificate of Incorporation of the Company, as in effect immediately
prior to the Effective Time, attached as Exhibit B hereto, shall be the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Surviving Corporation from and after the
Effective Time until further amended in accordance with applicable law.

(b) The By-laws of the Company, as in effect immediately prior to the Effective
Time, attached as Exhibit C hereto, shall be the By-laws of the Surviving
Corporation from and after the Effective Time until amended in accordance with
applicable law, the Certificate of Incorporation and such By-laws.

(c) The directors, officers and key employees listed in Exhibit D hereto shall
be the directors, officers and key employees of the Surviving Corporation, and
each shall hold his respective office or offices from and after the Effective
Time until his successor shall have been elected and shall have qualified in
accordance with applicable law, or as otherwise provided in the Certificate of
Incorporation or By-laws of the Surviving Corporation.

1.4 Assets and Liabilities. At the Effective Time, the Surviving Corporation
shall possess all the rights, privileges, powers and franchises of a public as
well as of a private nature, and be subject to all the restrictions,
disabilities and duties of each of Acquisition Corp and the Company
(collectively, the "Constituent Corporations"); and all the rights, privileges,
powers and franchises of each of the Constituent Corporations, and all property,
real, personal and mixed, and all debts due to any of the Constituent
Corporations on whatever account, as well for stock subscriptions as all other
things in action or belonging to each of the Constituent Corporations, shall be
vested in the Surviving Corporation; and all property, rights, privileges,
powers and franchises, and all and every other interest shall be thereafter as
effectively the property of the Surviving Corporation as they were of the
several and respective Constituent Corporations, and the title to any real
estate vested by deed or otherwise in either of the such Constituent
Corporations shall not revert or be in any way impaired by the Merger; but all
rights of creditors and all liens upon any property of any of the Constituent
Corporations shall be preserved unimpaired, and all debts, liabilities and
duties of the Constituent Corporations shall thenceforth attach to the Surviving
Corporation, and may be enforced against it to the same extent as if said debts,
liabilities and duties had been incurred or contracted by it.

virtue of the Merger and without any action on the part of the holder thereof,

delinquent in the payment of any Tax. The Company has not had a Tax deficiency
proposed or assessed against it and has not executed a waiver of any statute of
limitations on the assessment or collection of any Tax. None of the Company's

actions, suits, proceedings, investigations, claims or administrative
proceedings relating to Taxes or any Tax Returns of the Company now pending, and

claims or administrative proceedings relating to Taxes or any Tax Returns. The
Company is not obligated to make a payment, or is a party to an agreement that
under certain circumstances could obligate it to make a payment, that would not
be deductible under Section 280G of the Code. The Company has not agreed nor is
required to make any adjustments under Section 481(a) of the Code (or any
similar provision of state, local and foreign law) by reason of a change in
accounting method or otherwise for any Tax period for which the applicable
statute of limitations has not yet expired. The Company (i) is not a party to,
is bound by or has any obligation under, any Tax sharing agreement, Tax
indemnification agreement or similar contract or arrangement, whether written or
unwritten (collectively, "Tax Sharing Agreements"), or (ii) does not have any
potential liability or obligation to any person as a result of, or pursuant to,
any such Tax Sharing Agreements.

2.16 Patents and Other Intangible Assets. (a) Except as set forth in the
Memorandum or Schedule 2.16, the Company (i) owns or has the right to use, free
and clear of all Liens, claims and restrictions, all patents, trademarks,
service marks, trade names, copyrights, licenses and rights with respect to the
foregoing used in or necessary for the conduct of its business as now conducted
or proposed to be conducted without infringing upon or otherwise acting
adversely to the right or claimed right of any Person under or with respect to
any of the foregoing and (ii) is not obligated or under any liability to make
any payments by way of royalties, fees or otherwise to any owner or licensor of,
or other claimant to, any patent, trademark, service mark, trade name, copyright
or other intangible asset, with respect to the use thereof or in connection with
the conduct of its business or otherwise.

(b) To the best knowledge of the Company, the Company owns and has the
unrestricted right to use all trade secrets, if any, including know-how,
negative know-how, formulas, patterns, programs, devices, methods, techniques,
inventions, designs, processes, computer programs and technical data and all
information that derives independent economic value, actual or potential, from
not being generally known or known by competitors (collectively, "intellectual
property") required for or incident to the development, operation and sale of
all products and services sold by the Company, free and clear of any right, Lien
or claim of others; provided, however, the possibility exists that other
Persons, completely independent of the Company or its employees or agents, could
have developed intellectual property similar or identical to that of the

Liens (except as set forth in the Memorandum or any Schedule hereto) and other
encumbrances, except Permitted Liens and such ordinary and customary

indenture, loan or credit agreement, deed of trust, mortgage, security agreement
or other agreement or contract to which Parent or Acquisition Corp. is a party
or by which Parent and/or Acquisition Corp. or any of their respective

in reasonable detail to the extent then known by the Company Indemnified
Parties.

the following limitations:

sole and exclusive remedy of the Company Indemnified Parties against Parent and
Acquisition Corp. at law or equity for any matter covered by Section 12.1.

12.5    Notice of Claims.

(a) If, at any time on or prior to the Claims Deadline, Company Indemnified
Parties shall assert a claim for indemnification pursuant to Section 12.1, such
Company Indemnified Parties shall submit to Parent a written claim in good faith
signed by an authorized officer of the Company or other Company Indemnified
Parties, as applicable, stating: (i) that a Company Indemnified Party incurred
or reasonably believes it may incur Damages and the reasonable estimate of the
amount of any such Damages; (ii) in reasonable detail, the facts alleged as the
basis for such claim and the section or sections of this Agreement alleged as
the basis or bases for the claim; and (iii) if the Damages have actually been
incurred, the number of additional shares of Common Stock to which the
Stockholders are entitled with respect to such Damages, which shall be
determined as provided in Section 12.6 below. If the claim is for Damages which
the Company Indemnified Parties reasonably believe may be incurred or are
otherwise unliquidated, the written claim of the applicable Company Indemnified
Parties shall state the reasonable estimate of such Damages, in which event a
claim shall be deemed to have been asserted under this Article 12 in the amount

Stock to the Stockholders pursuant to Section 12.6 below shall be made until
such Damages have actually been incurred.

Company Indemnified Party with respect to which Parent may have liability under

defend such action, suit or proceeding in the name and on behalf of the Company
Indemnified Party; provided, however, that a Company Indemnified Party shall
have the right to retain its own counsel, with fees and expenses paid by Parent,
if representation of the Company Indemnified Party by counsel retained by Parent
would be inappropriate because of actual or potential differing interests
between Parent and the Company Indemnified Party. In connection with any action,
suit or proceeding subject to the Section 12 hereof, Parent and each Company
Indemnified Party agree to render to each other such assistance as may
reasonably be required in order to ensure proper and adequate defense of such
action, suit or proceeding. Parent shall not, without the prior written consent
of the applicable Company Indemnified Parties, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld or delayed, settle or compromise any claim or demand if
such settlement or compromise does not include an irrevocable and unconditional
release of such Company Indemnified Parties for any liability arising out of
such claim or demand.

12.6 Payment of Damages. In the event that the Company Indemnified Parties shall
be entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Section 12 for actual Damages
incurred by them, Parent shall, within thirty (30) days after the final
determination of the amount of such Damages, issue to the Stockholders that
number of additional shares of Common Stock in an aggregate amount equal to the
quotient obtained by dividing (x) the amount of such Damages by (y) the Fair
Market Value per share of the Common Stock as of the date (the "Determination
Date") of the submission of the notice of claim to Parent pursuant to Section
12.5. Such shares of Common Stock shall be issued to the Stockholders pro rata,
in proportion to the number of Parent Shares issued (or issuable) to the
Stockholders at the Effective Time and under the Private Placement.

                        MEDALLION CREST MANAGEMENT, INC.

      Medallion Crest Management, Inc., a Florida corporation (the
"Corporation"), DOES HEREBY CERTIFY:

      That the following resolution was duly adopted by the Board of Directors
of the Corporation (the "Board of Directors") by unanimous written consent
executed on November ___, 2004, pursuant to authority conferred upon the Board
of Directors by the provisions of the Articles of Incorporation of the
Corporation that authorizes the issuance of up to twenty million 20,000,000
shares of preferred stock, par value $0.0001 per share:

      "BE IT RESOLVED, that the issuance of a series of Preferred Stock of the
      Corporation is hereby authorized, and the designation, voting powers,
      preferences, and relative, participating, optional, and other special
      rights, and qualifications, limitations, and restrictions thereof, of the
      shares of such series, in addition to those set forth in the Articles of
      Incorporation of the Corporation, are hereby fixed as follows:

      1. Designation. Three Hundred (300) shares of preferred stock of the
Corporation shall constitute a class of preferred stock designated as "Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock" (the "Series A Preferred Stock").

      2. Dividends.

      (a) The holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
receive dividends when and if declared by the Board of Directors.

      (b) If at any time a dividend or distribution of assets is declared and
paid on the (i) the Corporation's common stock, par value $0.0001 per share (the
"Common Stock"), or (ii) any other class or series of the Corporation's capital
stock whether currently outstanding or hereafter created (the "Capital Stock"),
the Corporation shall, at the same time, declare and pay to each holder of
Series A Preferred Stock, pari passu with the holders of the Common Stock or the
Capital Stock, as applicable, a dividend equal to the dividend that would have
been payable to such holder if the shares of Series A Preferred Stock held by
such holder had been converted to Common Stock pursuant to Section 5 hereof
immediately prior to the record date for such dividend or distribution (or the
date of such dividend or distribution if no record date is fixed).


<PAGE>

      3. Rights on Liquidation, Merger, Sale, Etc. In the event of any voluntary
or involuntary liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Corporation (a
"Liquidation"), the assets of the Corporation available for distribution to its
shareholders, whether from capital, surplus or earnings, shall be distributed in
the following order of priority:

      (a) The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive,
prior and in preference to any distribution to the holders of Common Stock or
any other class of stock ranking junior to the Series A Preferred Stock, for
each share of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holders, an amount equal to
$25,000.00 per share (the "Purchase Price").

      (b) After distribution of the amounts set forth in Section 3(a)(i) hereof,
the remaining assets of the Corporation available for distribution, if any, to
the shareholders of the Corporation shall be distributed to the holders of the
Common Stock.

      4. Voting Rights. So long as any shares of Series A Preferred Stock remain
outstanding, the holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled
to vote on all matters on which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to
vote, casting such number of votes in respect of such shares of Series A
Preferred Stock as shall equal the largest whole number of shares of Common
Stock into which such shares of Series A Preferred Stock are then convertible
pursuant to Section 5 hereof, and voting together as one class with, and in the
same manner and with the same effect as, such holders of Common Stock.

      5. Conversion of Series A Preferred Stock.

      (a) The holders of Series A Preferred Stock shall have the right, at such
holders' option, at any time, to convert each share of Series A Preferred Stock
into such whole number of shares of Common Stock as is equal to the number of
fully paid and non-assessable shares of Common Stock which results from
multiplying the number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted by
the quotient of the Purchase Price divided by the Conversion Price (as
hereinafter defined) per share for the Series A Preferred Stock in effect at the
time of conversion. The initial Conversion Price per share of the Series A
Preferred Stock shall be $2.50, subject to adjustment as provided herein (the
"Conversion Price").

      (b) Before any holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
convert the same into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 5(a) hereof,
the holder or holders of such Series A Preferred Stock shall surrender the
certificate or certificates therefor, duly endorsed, at the office of the
Corporation or of any transfer agent for the Series A Preferred Stock, and shall
give written notice to the Corporation at its principal corporate office of the
election to convert the same (in case of conversion pursuant to Section 5(a)
hereof) and the name or names in which the certificate or certificates for
shares of Common Stock are to be issued. The Corporation shall, as soon as
practicable thereafter, issue and deliver at such office to such holder or
holders of Series A Preferred Stock, or to the nominee or nominees thereof, a
certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to which
such holder or holders shall be entitled as aforesaid. Conversion under this
Section 5 shall be deemed to have been made immediately prior to the close of
business on the date of such surrender of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock
to be converted, and the Person or Persons (as defined herein) entitled to
receive the shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion shall be
treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such shares of
Common Stock as of such date.


<PAGE>

      (c) The Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be subject
to adjustment from time to time as follows:

            (i) In the event the Corporation should at any time or from time to
      time after the date on which the shares of Series A Preferred Stock are
      first issued (the "Series A Issuance Date") fix a record date for the
      effectuation of a split or subdivision of the outstanding shares of Common
      Stock or the determination of holders of Common Stock entitled to receive
      a dividend or other distribution payable in additional shares of Common
      Stock or Common Stock equivalents without payment of any consideration by
      such holder for the additional shares of Common Stock or the Common Stock
      equivalents (including the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon
      conversion or exercise thereof), then, as of such record date (or the date
      of such dividend distribution, split or subdivision if no record date is
      fixed), the Conversion Price of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
      appropriately decreased so that the number of shares of Common Stock
      issuable upon conversion of each share of such Series A Preferred Stock
      shall be increased in proportion to such increase in the aggregate of
      shares of Common Stock outstanding and issuable with respect to such
      Common Stock equivalents.

            (ii) If the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any time
      after the Series A Issuance Date is decreased by a combination of the
      outstanding shares of Common Stock, then, following the record date of
      such combination, the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock
      shall be appropriately increased so that the number of shares of Common
      Stock issuable on conversion of each share of each series shall be
      decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares.

      (d) If at any time or from time to time there shall be a recapitalization
of the Common Stock (other than a subdivision, combination or merger or sale of
assets transaction provided for elsewhere in this Section 5), provision shall be
made so that the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter be
entitled to receive upon conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock the number
of shares of stock or other securities or property of the Corporation or
otherwise, to which a holder of Common Stock deliverable upon conversion would
have been entitled on such recapitalization. In any such case, appropriate
adjustment shall be made in the application of the provisions of this Section 5
with respect to the rights of the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock after
the recapitalization to the end that the provisions of this Section 5 (including
adjustment of the Conversion Price for the Series A Preferred Stock then in
effect and the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the Series A
Preferred Stock) shall be applicable after that event as nearly equivalent as
may be practicable.

      (e) The Corporation shall not, by amendment of its Articles of
Incorporation or through any reorganization, recapitalization, transfer of
assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any
other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance or performance of
any of the terms to be observed or performed hereunder by the Corporation, but
will at all times in good faith assist in the carrying out of all the provisions
of this Section 5 and in the taking of all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order to protect the conversion rights of the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock against impairment.

<PAGE>

      (f) If the Corporation should effect any capital reorganization or
reclassification of its capital stock or cause to occur a Disposition Event (as
defined herein) while any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are outstanding in
such a manner that holders of shares of Common Stock shall be entitled to
receive stock, securities or assets with respect to or in exchange for Common
Stock, then, as a condition of such reorganization, reclassification or
Disposition Event, lawful and adequate provision shall be made whereby each
holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall thereafter have the right to receive
upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified herein and in lieu of
the shares of Common Stock immediately theretofore receivable upon conversion of
Series A Preferred Stock, such shares of stock, securities or assets as may be
issued or payable with respect to or in exchange for a number of outstanding
shares of such Common Stock equal to the number of shares of such Common Stock
immediately theretofore so receivable had such reorganization, reclassification
or Disposition Event not taken place, and in such case appropriate provision
shall be made with respect to the rights and interests of the holders of Series
A Preferred Stock to the end that the provisions hereof (including, without
limitation, provisions for adjustment of the Conversion Price of the Series A
Preferred Stock and of the number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion thereof) shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as may be
possible, in relation to any shares of stock, securities or assets thereafter
deliverable upon the conversion of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock.
Prior to or simultaneously with the consummation of a Disposition Event the
survivor or successor corporation (if other than the Corporation) resulting from
such Disposition Event shall assume by written instrument executed and mailed or
delivered to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock, the obligation to deliver
to such holders of Series A Preferred Stock such shares of stock, securities or
assets as, in accordance with the foregoing provisions, such holder of Series A
Preferred Stock may be entitled to receive, and containing the express
assumption of such successor corporation of the due and punctual performance and
observance of every provision of these Articles of Incorporation to be performed
and observed by the Corporation and of all liabilities and obligations of the
Corporation hereunder with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock.

      (g) (i) No fractional shares shall be issued upon the conversion of any
share or shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, and the number of shares of
Common Stock to be issued shall be rounded to the nearest whole share. In lieu
of any fractional shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the
Corporation shall make a cash payment equal to the "fair market value" of the
Common Stock as of two business days prior to payment multiplied by such
fraction. For the purposes of this Section 5(h)(i), "fair market value" shall
mean on any day (A) if shares of the Common Stock are listed or admitted for
trading on a national securities exchange, the reported last sales price or, if
no such reported sale occurs on such day, the average of the closing bid and
asked prices on such day, in each case on the principal national securities
exchange on which the Common Shares are listed or admitted to trading, (B) if
shares of Common Stock are not listed or admitted to trading on any national
securities exchange, the average of the closing bid and asked prices in the
over-the-counter market on such day as reported by Nasdaq or any comparable
system or, if not so reported, as reported by any New York Stock Exchange member
firm selected by the Corporation for such purpose or (C) if no such quotations
are available on such day, the fair market value of one share of Common Stock on
such day as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

<PAGE>

Upon the occurrence of each adjustment of the Conversion Price of Series A
Preferred Stock pursuant to this Section 5, the Corporation, at its expense,
shall promptly compute such adjustment in accordance with the terms hereof and
prepare and furnish to each holder of Series A Preferred Stock a statement,
signed by its President and Chief Financial Officer, setting forth such
adjustment and showing in detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based.
The Corporation shall, upon the written request at any time of any holder of
Series A Preferred Stock, furnish or cause to be furnished to such holder a like
certificate setting forth (A) such adjustment, (B) the Conversion Price for such
Series A Preferred Stock at the time in effect and (C) the number of shares of
Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other property which at the time would
be received upon the conversion of a share of such Series A Preferred Stock.

In the event of any taking by the Corporation of a record of the holders of any
class of securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are
entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or other
distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase or otherwise acquire any
shares of stock of any class or any other securities or property, or to receive
any other right, the Corporation shall mail to each holder of Series A Preferred
Stock, at least 20 days prior to the date specified therein, a notice specifying
the date on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such
dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and character of such dividend,
distribution or right.

The Corporation shall at all times reserve and keep available out of its
authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose of
effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series A Preferred Stock, such
number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be sufficient to
effect the conversion of all outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred Stock;
and if at any time the number of authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock
shall not be sufficient to effect the conversion of all then outstanding shares
of the Series A Preferred Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be
available to the holder of such Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation will
take such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary
to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock to such number of
shares as shall be sufficient for such purposes, including, without limitation,
engaging in best efforts to obtain the requisite shareholder approval of any
necessary amendment to these provisions. The Corporation shall pay all
documentary, stamp or other transactional taxes attributable to the issuance or
delivery of shares of capital stock of the Corporation upon conversion of any
shares of Series A Preferred Stock; provided, however, that the Corporation
shall not be required to pay any taxes which may be payable in respect of any
transfer involved in the issuance or delivery of any certificate for such shares
in a name other than that of the holder of the shares of Series A Preferred
Stock in respect of which such shares are being issued. All shares of Common
Stock which may be issued in connection with the conversion provisions set forth
herein will, upon issuance by the Corporation, be validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens or charges with respect thereto.

Any notice required by the provisions of this Section 5 to be given to the
holders of shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be deemed given if deposited
in the United States mail, postage prepaid, and addressed to each holder of
record at his address appearing on the stock books of the Corporation.

<PAGE>

In the event any shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be converted pursuant
to Section 5 hereof, the shares so converted shall be cancelled. The Articles of
Incorporation of the Corporation may be appropriately amended from time to time
to effect the corresponding reduction in the Corporation's authorized capital
stock.

For purposes of this Certificate:

"Disposition Event" shall mean (A) the direct or indirect sale, lease, exchange
or other transfer of all or substantially all of the assets or authorized but
unissued capital stock of the Corporation to any other Person or Persons or (B)
the merger or consolidation of the Corporation with and into another corporation
or corporations in which the shareholders of the Corporation immediately prior
to such merger or consolidation do not own more than 50% of the voting control
of the surviving corporation.

"Person" shall mean an individual, partnership, corporation, limited liability
company, business trust, joint stock company, trust, unincorporated association,
joint venture, governmental authority or other entity of whatever nature,
including, as appropriate, the Corporation or any subsidiary thereof.

                      SECOND AMENDMENT TO CEPTOR AGREEMENT

        Second Amendment dated this __ day of November, 2004 to that certain
Agreement ("Agreement") by and among William Pursley ("WP"), Ceptor Corporation
("Ceptor") and Xechem International, Inc. ("Xechem").

                                          RECITALS:

        WHEREAS, the parties entered into the Agreement on March 31, 2004 (the
"Original Agreement") to provide a mechanism for among other things,
facilitating the independent financing of Ceptor, and a means of liquidity for
Xechem.

        WHEREAS, the parties entered into a First Amendment to Ceptor Agreement
on April __, 2004 (the "First Amendment" and together with the Original
Agreement, the "Agreements") in order to further the purposes of the Original
Agreement by adding to and modifying certain terms and provisions of the
Original Agreement.

        WHEREAS, the parties are desirous of amending the Original Agreement and
First Amendment to further delineate their respective rights and obligations as
set forth below, which will supersede any inconsistencies or ambiguities in the
Agreements.

        Capitalized terms used herein and not otherwise defined shall have the
same meaning as set forth in the Original Agreement or as such may be modified
by the First Amendment and in the PPM (as hereinafter defined).

        NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and covenants contained
herein, the parties agree as follows:

        1. Recitals. The recitals set forth above are incorporated herein by
reference as if fully rewritten.

        2. PPM. Xechem acknowledges it has received a copy of the Confidential
Private Placement Memorandum of Ceptor dated October 22, 2004 (the "PPM") and
that the Board of Directors of Xechem have approved the PPM and the "Offering"
and other transactions described therein and has or will adopt any resolutions
as stockholder of Ceptor to authorize the taking of all actions by Ceptor
necessary or appropriate to effectuate the transactions described therein and
consummate the "Merger" of Ceptor with and into a subsidiary of Company (as such
terms are defined in the PPM) and subsequent merger of Ceptor into Company for
the purpose of effectuating a change of domicile of Company from Florida to
Delaware. Xechem agrees that it shall take all further actions reasonably
requested by Ceptor in order to effectuate the intent and purposes of the
Agreements and the transactions described in the PPM.

        3. Exchange Ratio and Shares. Xechem agrees and consents to an exchange
ratio of Company Common Stock to be exchanged for each share of presently
outstanding of Ceptor common stock of 2.26567:1. Xechem acknowledges that it
presently is the record holder of 1,800,000 of the issued and outstanding shares
of common stock of Ceptor, par value $0.00001 per share, which prior to
redemption as contemplated in Section 4 hereof, will be converted into 3,898,213
shares of Company Common Stock.

<PAGE>

        4. Put Option. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
Section 5.0(b) of the Original Agreement as amended by Section 2 of the First
Amendment, the number of shares of Ceptor to be "Put" by Xechem pursuant to the
"Put" obligation shall be that amount of shares equal to the quotient of: (a)
ten (10%) percent of the gross cash raised (before any commissions or other
expenses) in each tranche of equity financing by Ceptor (or the Company or any
other publicly traded parent of Ceptor) into which shares of the common stock of
Ceptor presently outstanding may be exchanged in connection with the Merger of
Ceptor with and into any subsidiary of Company or such other entity; divided by
(b) the price per share of common stock of Company or other entity (the "Issue
Price") at which such equity tranche is raised (and if in the form of preferred
stock, then the price per share will be computed based upon the number of shares
of common stock into which such preferred stock would be converted were the
preferred stock to immediately convert to common stock, and, provided, further,
that the value or conversion of any warrants or other consideration shall be
disregarded in such calculation).

        Under the terms of the PPM, Ceptor is raising by the sale of shares of
Common Stock of Company a minimum of $2.5 million and maximum of $6.0 million
from the offering of Units, each Unit consisting of one share of Series A
Preferred Stock and a warrant for 5,000 shares of common stock of the Company,
exercisable at $1.25 per share. Units are offered by the Placement Agent for
sale at $25,000 per Unit. Shares of Series A Preferred Stock will be convertible
into 10,000 shares of Company Common Stock (or $2.50 per share of Common Stock).

        For the absence of doubt, under the PPM, assuming gross Offering
proceeds of $2.5 million from the sale of 100 Units, Xechem would exercise its
Put for $250,000 in cancellation of 100,000 shares ($2,500,000 x .10 =
$250,000/$2.50 = 100,000); and assuming gross Offering proceeds of $6.0 million
from the sale of 240 Units, Xechem would exercise its Put for $600,000 in
cancellation of 240,000 shares ($6,000,000 x .10 = $600,000/$2.50 = 240,000).

        Upon closing of any sales of Units under the Offering Xechem shall be
required to and without further action by Xechem shall be deemed to exercise its
Put as set forth herein, provided, however, that in no event shall one or more
exercises of the Put result in any amount in excess of $2.0 million being
redeemed by Company.

        Each further tranche of shares of equity to be sold by Ceptor or any
Ceptor parent or affiliate subsequent to the PPM will result in exercise of the
Put by Xechem, and shall be priced at the issue price per share for the tranche
of equity corresponding to the Put to the greatest extent that is consistent
with the principles set forth in the foregoing paragraphs, provided, however,
that Xechem's Put obligation (and Ceptor's redemption obligation, or that of its
parent or affiliate) will cease once Xechem has Put $2.0 million, in the
aggregate, to Ceptor or any Ceptor parent or affiliate.

        For the absence of doubt, if Xechem has Put $600,000 (240,000 shares) to
Company and subsequently, Company raises $1,000,000 of equity based upon a price
of $2.50 per share in tranche 1 (i.e., 400,000 shares) and $10,000,000 of equity
based upon a price of $4.00 per share in tranche 2 (i.e., 2,500,000 shares),
then Xechem would Put 40,000 shares for $2.50 per share in tranche 1 ($100,000)
and 250,000 shares in tranche 2 ($1,000,000), resulting in aggregate Put
proceeds of $1,100,000.

<PAGE>

        If, however, tranche 2 were $20,000,000 at $4.00 per share, then Xechem
would Put 500,000 shares in tranche 2 ($2,000,000), reduce by $700,000
previously Put (175,000 shares), or $1,300,000, or an additional 325,000 shares,
net ($600,000 (PPM) + $100,000 (tranche 1) = $700,000. $2,000,000 - $700,000 =
$1,300,000 net Put remaining. $1,300,000/$4.00 = 325,000 shares to extinguish
Put.

        Xechem shall continue to be entitled to the royalty of two (2%) percent
of gross revenues received by Ceptor, its subsidiaries, affiliates and assigns
with respect to the sale of any products incorporating any of the Ceptor IP or
the licensing of any of the Ceptor IP (or the sale of the licensing rights to
any of the Ceptor IP or the sale of any of the Ceptor IP).

        The remainder of the substantive provisions of Section 5.0(b) of the
Original Agreement shall remain in place, subject to the modification of the
terms of any indebtedness of Ceptor or exchange of such indebtedness for
Replacement Notes of Company, to reflect the terms set forth in the PPM,
including any cancellations or additional consideration in connection with the
Exchange Offer of Bridge Loans and/or 10% Notes for Replacement Notes as shall
be determined in the sole discretion of Ceptor management, from time to time.

        5. Lock-up. Of the shares of Common Stock to be issued to and held by
Xechem pursuant to the PPM (and as set forth in Section 3, above), the entire
amount held is subject to a lock-up agreement amongst the parties to this
Agreement under which Xechem agrees that it may not sell any of its shares for a
period of six months following the effective date of the registration of the
shares purchased in the Offering or the registration of the shares of common
stock underlying the Preferred Stock (the "Underlying Common") as described in
the PPM, and may only sell up to fifty (50%) percent thereafter until one (1)
year following the effective date of such registration of shares purchased in
the Offering (or the Underlying Common) described in the PPM; provided further,
if for whatever reason the shares purchased in the Offering or the Underlying
Shares are not registered within one hundred eighty (180) days following the
termination of this Offering (the "Outside Date") then those shares shall be
deemed to have been registered as of the Outside Date for purposes of this
Section 5. In addition, if the Company engages an underwriter or placement agent
during the twelve (12) month period following the final Closing to occur under
the PPM, in order to raise a minimum of $5.0 million through the sale of the
Company other equity securities (or securities that may be convertible into
Company equity securities), in a public offering or private placement, upon
notice of commencing such public offering or private placement, Xechem agrees to
the terms of any further lock-up agreements required by the underwriter or
placement agent thereof, and agrees that it shall refrain from making any sales,
transfers or other dispositions in the course of such offering, but, in any
event, for not more than ninety (90) days from the date of effectiveness of such
further lock-up agreement, or ninety (90) days following the termination of such
offering, whichever is less. Xechem agrees that its piggyback registration
rights shall be inapplicable to registration of the share of Common Stock of
Company issued pursuant to the PPM, provided that such piggyback registration
shall be effected at the same time as registration of any Founder's Shares
issued pursuant to the Founder's Stock Plan is effected, as described in the
PPM. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Xechem shall be permitted
to transfer shares of the Common Stock to any person or entity who agrees to be
bound proportionately to the redemption and lock-up provisions hereof.

<PAGE>

        6. Placement Agent Agreement. A true and correct copy of the Placement
Agent Agreement by and between Brookshire Securities Corporation and Ceptor is
annexed as Exhibit A hereto. Xechem authorizes and approves the Placement Agent
Agreement, including the payment of all fees and expenses, as provided therein,
and all agreements of indemnification or contribution therein.

        7. Ratification. All actions of Ceptor, its officers, directors,
attorneys, accountants, advisors, lenders, consultants, and other parties which
have been disclosed to Xechem or any of its directors, are hereby ratified,
confirmed and approved by Xechem as stockholder of Ceptor in all respects, and
Ceptor shall be authorized to proceed in all respects as described in the PPM.

        IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the undersigned have executed this Second Amendment
as of the date first set forth above, which Second Amendment shall be binding if
delivered in counterpart or one integrated document by original, photocopy or
facsimile.
