outstanding. The percentages reported in this statement have been rounded to the
nearest one-tenth of a percent.

         Mr. Aitken beneficially owns 1,963,573 shares of Common Stock, or 4.3%,
of the outstanding shares of Common Stock, through (i) his beneficial ownership
of 759,207 shares of Common Stock; (ii) his beneficial ownership of the 11,366
shares of Common Stock held by Aitken (English) Company Limited and 20,000

         (c) During the last 60 days, Mr. Aitken has not effected any
transactions in the Common Stock, except that:

                  (i) On May 28, 2004, Mr. Aitken sold 60,000 shares of Common
         Stock in an open market transaction to an existing shareholder of the
         Company. The purchaser agreed not to sell or otherwise transfer such
         60,000 shares for a period of 90 days subsequent to the Public Offering
         (as defined in Item 6 below).

                  (ii) On July 7, 2004, upon the consummation of the Public
         Offering, each of Mr. Aitken and Aitken (English) Company converted

losses or the giving or withholding of proxies. The following descriptions of
various agreements are qualified in their entirety by reference to the copies of
such agreements that are attached hereto as exhibits and incorporated herein by
reference.

         Bonus Share Issuance. On April 22, 2002, the Company issued the Bonus
Shares to Timothy M. Aitken as compensation for services rendered to the
Company. Such issuance is referred to herein as "Bonus Share Issuance." The
Bonus Share Issuance to Mr. Aitken was unanimously approved by the board of
directors of the Company (with Mr. Aitken abstaining because of his interest in
the transaction) at a meeting held on April 19, 2002, subject to final approval
by the independent directors of the Company at a separate meeting. The Bonus
Share Issuance was approved by the independent directors of the Company at a
meeting of the independent directors held on April 21, 2002.

         Tax Agreement. In connection with the Bonus Share Issuance, on April

the Company formerly known as Transworld Healthcare (UK) Limited ("TWUK"),
entered into a Tax Bonus, Tax Loan and Tax Indemnification Agreement (the "Tax
Agreement") with Mr. Aitken. The purpose of the Tax Agreement was to provide Mr.
Aitken with substantially all of the cash (through a cash bonus and a loan from
the Company) necessary for him to pay the federal, New York State and New York
City income taxes that he is expected to incur as a result of the Bonus Share
Issuance and to provide him with the tax indemnity described below. The Tax
Agreement was approved by the board of directors of the Company on April 19,
2002 (with Mr. Aitken abstaining because of his interest in the transaction),
subject to final approval by the independent directors of the Company at a
separate meeting. The Tax Agreement was approved by the independent directors at
a separate meeting on April 21, 2002.

         Pursuant to the Tax Agreement, on April 30, 2002, the Company made a
cash payment to Mr. Aitken in the amount of $1,401,263 and loaned Mr. Aitken the
amount of $550,000. The loan was subsequently repaid, as described below.

         Pursuant to the Tax Agreement, TWUK will be obligated to indemnify Mr.
Aitken for federal, New York State and New York City taxable income in excess of
an agreed-upon amount that may arise from the Bonus Share Issuance. However,
TWUK's indemnity obligation to Mr. Aitken is capped at $622,371. Moreover, of
the tax indemnity payments, if any, to Mr. Aitken, an amount equal to 20% of
such excess taxable income will be made in the form of a loan. TWUK's obligation
to make indemnity payments, if any are required to be made, is subject to the
receipt from certain of TWUK's lenders of their consent to such payment.

         Promissory Note. The loan to Mr. Aitken that the Company made on April
30, 2002 pursuant to the Tax Agreement was evidenced by a promissory note in the
principal amount of $550,000 executed by Mr. Aitken. The promissory note bore
interest at a rate of 4.65% per annum.

         On December 2, 2003, Mr. Aitken repaid in full the principal of and
accrued interest on the promissory note. The principal and accrued interest
aggregated $590,500. The loan was repaid by the delivery to the Company of
103,596 shares of Common Stock held by Mr. Aitken, valued at $5.70 per share,
the closing price of a share of Common Stock on the day prior to the


                                     Page 7

repayment date. The Company also agreed to reimburse Mr. Aitken for the taxes
incurred by him on the disposition of the shares to the Company, which are
estimated to be approximately $83,395.

         Mr. Aitken's obligations under the promissory note were secured by a
pledge by him to the Company, pursuant to a Pledge and Security Agreement, dated
April 30, 2002, of certain of the securities of the Company owned by him. Mr.
Aitken's obligations under the Pledge and Security Agreement were terminated
simultaneously with the payment of the promissory note.

         Reorganization Agreement. On July 25, 2002, the Company consummated a
reorganization (the "Reorganization") involving the Company and two of its U.K.
subsidiaries, Allied Healthcare Group Limited ("Allied Healthcare (UK)") and
TWUK. The Reorganization was consummated pursuant to a Master Reorganization
Agreement, dated as of April 24, 2002, as amended on May 16, 2002 and June 26,
2002 (the "Reorganization Agreement"), among the Company, Allied Healthcare
(UK), TWUK and certain investors in such subsidiaries, including Mr. Aitken. In
the Reorganization, equity investments in TWUK and subordinated debt investments
in Allied Healthcare (UK) were exchanged for shares of Common Stock and shares
of Series A Preferred Stock.

         As a result of Mr. Aitken's and Aitken (English) Company Limited's
ownership of equity investments in TWUK and debt investments in Allied
Healthcare (UK), in the Reorganization Mr. Aitken was issued 11,366 shares of
Common Stock and 87,200 shares of Series A Preferred Stock and Aitken (English)
Company Limited was issued 11,367 shares of Common Stock and 87,200 shares of
Series A Preferred Stock (an aggregate of 174,400 shares of Series A Preferred
Stock).

         Registration Rights Agreement. On July 25, 2002, in connection with the
consummation of the Reorganization, the Company entered into a Registration
Rights Agreement. Pursuant to this Registration Rights Agreement, the Company is
required to file a registration statement covering the resale of all of the
shares of Common Stock issued or issuable as a result of the consummation of the
Reorganization (including the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the Series A Preferred Stock), as well as certain other shares of stock then
outstanding, including the Bonus Shares issued to Mr. Aitken. The registration
statement contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement was declared
effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission on August 21, 2002.

         Resale Prospectus. On February 9, 2004, the Company filed a
Registration Statement on Form S-8 relating to the issuance of shares of Common
Stock under its 2002 Stock Option Plan. Such Registration Statement contained a
resale prospectus permitting Mr. Aitken to resell the shares of Common Stock
issuable upon exercise of the employee stock options granted to him (whether
granted pursuant to the 2002 Stock Option Plan or the 1992 Stock Option Plan of
the Company).

         Option Grants. Mr. Aitken has been issued options to purchase shares of
Common Stock under the 2002 Stock Option Plan and the 1992 Stock Option Plan of
the Company. His outstanding options are summarized in Item 3 of this Amendment
No. 4 to Schedule 13D.

         Lock-Up Agreement. On July 7, 2004, the Company consummated an
underwritten public offering of 14,500,000 shares of Common Stock (the "Public
Offering"). On July 1, 2004, Mr. Aitken entered into a Lock-Up Agreement
pursuant to which he agreed not to offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise
dispose of (either directly or through an affiliate) any shares of capital stock
of the Company for a period of 90 days subsequent to July 1, 2004, except as
permitted therein.

         Conversion Agreements. On July 7, 2004, the Company consummated the
Public Offering. Pursuant to Conversion Agreements which each of Mr. Aitken and
Aitken (English) Company had entered into (as had all holders of Series A
Preferred Stock), upon the consummation of such Public Offering, each of Mr.
Aitken and Aitken (English) Company converted 87,200 shares of Series A
Preferred Stock into 87,200 shares of Common Stock. In connection with such
conversion, (a) Mr. Aitken received $82,874 in accrued and unpaid dividends on
his shares of Series A Preferred Stock and a conversion fee of $22,816 and (b)
Aitken (English) Company received $82,874 in accrued and unpaid dividends on its
shares of Series A Preferred Stock and a conversion fee of $22,816.

                              CONVERSION AGREEMENT


         This Agreement is entered into as of April 28, 2004, by and among
Allied Healthcare International Inc., a New York corporation (the "COMPANY"),
and Timothy Aitken (the "HOLDER").

         WHEREAS, the Company intends to conduct an underwritten public offering
of its common stock, par value $.01 per share (the "COMMON STOCK"), during the
next several months; and

         WHEREAS, the Holder desires to exercise their conversion rights with
respect to the shares of Series A convertible preferred stock, $.01 par value
per share (the "PREFERRED STOCK"), of the Company beneficially owned by the
Holder pursuant to Section 5(a) of the Certificate of Amendment to the
Certificate of Incorporation of the Company defining the rights and preferences
of the Preferred Stock.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual
agreements herein contained and other good and valuable consideration, the
receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, the Company and the Holder hereby agree
as follows:

         1. Conversion of the Preferred Stock into Common Stock. Conditioned
upon and effective as of the closing of an underwritten public offering by the
Company of its Common Stock with a minimum of $50 million in gross proceeds to
the Company, which closes on or prior to December 31, 2004 (the "OFFERING"),
each share of Preferred Stock owned by such Holder will be converted (the
"CONVERSION") into one (1) share of Common Stock and the Company will pay each
Holder in cash all accumulated but unpaid dividends thereon, whether or not any
such dividends have been declared, computed through the date of the Conversion
within five (5) business days following the closing of the Offering. In the
event that the Offering is not closed on or prior to December 31, 2004, this
Agreement, including Section 4 hereof, shall be of no further force or effect.

         2. Certificates. Upon surrender of the certificates representing the
Preferred Stock, the Company shall issue certificates evidencing the issuance of
Common Stock to the Holder in the amount set forth opposite such Holder's name
as set forth on Exhibit A hereto. Upon notice of the closing of the Offering,
the Holder agrees to promptly deliver to the Company (and in any event within
five (5) business days thereafter) all certificates evidencing the Preferred
Stock, duly endorsed for transfer.

         3. Conversion Fee. The Company shall pay to the Holder within five (5)
business days following the closing of the Offering, a conversion fee equal to
$22,816 (the "CONVERSION FEE"). Notwithstanding the foregoing, if at anytime
within the six (6) month period following the closing of the Offering, the
Company's Common Stock trades above $11.32 for ten (10) out of any period of
thirty (30) consecutive trading days during such six (6) month period (the tenth
such day being the "THRESHOLD DATE"), then the Holder shall pay to the Company
an amount equal to the pro rata portion of the Conversion Fee attributable to
such six (6) month period occurring after the Threshold Date. By way of
illustration, if the Offering closes on June 1, 2004 and the Threshold Date
occurs on October 1, 2004, then the Holder shall pay to the Company an


<PAGE>

amount equal to 33.33% of the Conversion Fee or $7,605. The Holder shall pay
such amount to the Company within five (5) business days after the end of the
six (6) month period following closing of the Offering.

         4. Confirmation. The undersigned Holder confirms that (i) this election
is unconditional and irrevocable subject only to the closing of the Offering,
and the conversion date of the Holder's shares of Preferred Stock shall be
deemed to be the closing date of the Offering for all purposes; (ii) upon
delivery of the shares of Common Stock described on Exhibit A, all accrued or
unpaid dividends, and the amount described in Section 3 hereof by the Company to
the Holder, the Holder shall have no other claims against the Company or any
subsidiary or affiliate thereof as Holder of the Preferred Stock or pursuant to
the Certificate of Designations of the Company under which the Preferred Stock
was authorized and issued.

         5. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of
and be binding upon the successors and assigns of each of the parties hereto.

         6. Amendment and Waiver. This Agreement may be amended, modified or
supplemented, and waivers of or consents to departures from the provisions
hereof may be given, provided that any such amendments, modifications or
supplements are in writing and signed by each of the parties hereto.

         7. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts and by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which
when so executed shall be deemed to be an original and all of which when taken
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.
