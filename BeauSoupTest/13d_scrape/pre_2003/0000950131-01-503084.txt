Item 1.    Security and Issuer.
           -------------------

     This Schedule 13D relates to the common stock, par value $1.00 per share
(the "Common Stock"), of Trinity Industries, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the
"Issuer"). The principal executive offices of the Issuer are located at 2525
Stemmons Freeway, Dallas, Texas 75207.

Item 2.  Identity and Background.
         -----------------------

     This statement is being filed by (i) Thrall Car Management Company, Inc., a
Delaware corporation ("Management Company"), and (ii) Craig J. Duchossois.

     Management Company, through its subsidiaries, engages in the manufacture of
rail cars. As described more fully in Item 6, the Issuer, in connection with the
transactions reported in this Schedule 13D, is acquiring certain direct and
indirect subsidiaries of Management Company that manufacture rail cars. The
address of Management Company's principal business and principal office is 845
Larch Avenue, Elmhurst, Illinois 60126. Appendix A hereto, which is incorporated
herein by this reference, sets forth the name, business address, present
principal occupation or employment (and the name, principal business and address
of any corporation or other organization in which such employment is conducted)
and the citizenship of the directors, executive officers and control persons of
Management Company.

     Craig J. Duchossois is principally employed as the Chief Executive Officer
of Duchossois Industries, Inc. His business address is 845 Larch Avenue,
Elmhurst, Illinois 60126. He is a citizen of the United States. The principal
address of Duchossois Industries, Inc., an Illinois corporation, is 845 Larch
Avenue, Elmhurst, Illinois 60126. Duchossois Industries, Inc., through its
subsidiaries, engages in the manufacture of commercial and consumer access
control devices and precision machined metal products, and has interests in
entertainment and venture capital.

     During the last five years, neither Management Company nor Craig J.
Duchossois, and, to the best knowledge of either of them, none of the persons
listed on Appendix A attached hereto, has been (i) convicted in a criminal
proceeding (excluding traffic violations or similar misdemeanors) or (ii) a
party to a civil proceeding of a judicial or administrative body of competent
jurisdiction and as a result of such proceeding was or is subject to a judgment,
decree or final order enjoining future violations of, or prohibiting or
mandating activities subject to, federal or state securities laws or finding any
violation with respect to such laws.

Item 3.   Source and Amount of Funds or Other Consideration.
          -------------------------------------------------

          The response to Item 6 is incorporated herein by this reference.

          Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of August 13,
2001 (the "Merger Agreement"), among the Issuer, TCMC Acquisition Corp., an
Illinois corporation ("Merger Sub"), Thrall Car Manufacturing Company, an
Illinois corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Management Company
("Manufacturing Company"), and Management Company, the Issuer will acquire
Manufacturing Company, and Management Company will acquire shares of the Issuer,
all as more fully described in Item 6. The 600,000 shares of Common Stock

                                       4
<PAGE>

currently held by Company were acquired with Manufacturing Company's
working capital.

Item 4.  Purpose of Transaction.
         ----------------------

          The response to Item 6 is incorporated herein by this reference.

          The purpose of the transaction is for most of Management Company's
direct and indirect subsidiaries to become part of the Issuer's operations,
while allowing Management Company to maintain an investment in the rail car
manufacturing industry through the ownership of shares of Common Stock. Although
Management Company may designate one nominee to the Issuer's board of directors,
neither Management Company nor Mr. Duchossois has acquired shares of Common
Stock with the intention of acquiring control of the Issuer. The Stockholder's
Agreement (as defined below) will place certain restrictions on the ability of
Management Company and its Affiliates, including Mr. Duchossois, to acquire or
dispose of securities of the Issuer.

          The foregoing response to this Item 4 is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Merger Agreement and the form of Stockholder's Agreement to be
entered into by the Issuer and Management Company (the "Stockholder's
Agreement"), which are filed as Exhibits 2 and 3 hereto, respectively.

Item 5.   Interest in Securities of the Issuer.
          ------------------------------------

          The response to Item 6 is incorporated herein by this reference.

          Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Management Company, for the purposes
of Rule 13d-3 as promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
amended (the "Exchange Act"), may be deemed to beneficially own, and have sole
voting and disposition power of, 7,150,000 shares of Common Stock. Currently,
Manufacturing Company owns of record 600,000 shares of Common Stock, and as the
sole shareholder of Manufacturing Company, Management Company may be deemed to
beneficially own, and have shared voting and disposition power of, these 600,000
shares. It is currently anticipated that Manufacturing Company will transfer
these 600,000 shares to Management Company prior to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Merger Agreement. Management Company may be
deemed to have shared voting and disposition power of these shares with the
directors and executive officers of Manufacturing Company. The names of, and
information with respect to, the directors and executive officers of
Manufacturing Company are set forth on Appendix B to this Schedule 13D, which is
incorporated herein by this reference. Based on a total of 44,133,562 shares of
Common Stock outstanding (36,983,562 shares of Common Stock reported outstanding
as of June 30, 2001, pursuant to the Issuer's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period
ended June 30, 2001 (the "Pre-Merger Outstanding Shares") plus the 7,150,000
shares of Common Stock to be issued to Management Company in accordance with the
Merger Agreement (the "Merger Shares" and, collectively with the Pre-Merger
Outstanding Shares, the "Post-Merger Outstanding Shares")), for purposes of Rule
13d-3, Management Company may be deemed to beneficially own 17.6% of the Post-
Merger Outstanding Shares.

                                       5
<PAGE>

          By virtue of his position as a director and executive officer and, as
described on Appendix A, his ability to vote a majority of the outstanding
shares of Management Company, Mr. Duchossois, for purposes of Rule 13d-3, may be
deemed to beneficially own the Merger Shares. Mr. Duchossois shares voting and
disposition power with respect to these shares of Common Stock with the
directors and executive officers of Management Company. The names of, and
information with respect to, these persons are set forth on Appendix A to this
Schedule 13D, which is incorporated herein by this reference. Similarly, by
virtue of his positions with Management Company (which is the sole shareholder
of Manufacturing Company) and Manufacturing Company, Mr. Duchossois, for
purposes of Rule 13d-3, may be deemed to beneficially own the 600,000 shares
currently owned of record by Manufacturing Company. Mr. Duchossois may be deemed
to have shared voting and disposition power with respect to these shares with
the directors and executive officers of Management Company, information with
respect to which is set forth on Appendix A to this Schedule 13D and
incorporated herein by this reference, and the directors and executive officers
of Manufacturing Company, information with respect to which is set forth on
Appendix B hereto and incorporated herein by this reference. The Merger Shares,
when aggregated with the 600,000 shares of Common Stock currently owned of
record by Manufacturing Company and 150 shares currently owned of record by Mr.
Duchossois, would result in Mr. Duchossois being deemed to beneficially own
7,750,150 shares of Common Stock, or 17.6% of the Post-Merger Outstanding
Shares. Mr. Duchossois disclaims beneficial ownership of the 7,750,000 shares
not owned of record by him.

          Except as disclosed herein, neither Management Company nor Craig J.
Duchossois has effected any transactions in shares of Common Stock during the
preceding 60 days.

Item 6.   Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships
          with Respect to Securities of the Issuer.
          ----------------------------------------

          The following response to this Item 6 is qualified in its entirety by
reference to the Merger Agreement, the form of Stockholder's Agreement and the
Form of Registration Rights Agreement to be entered into by the Issuer and
Management Company (the "Registration Rights Agreement"), which are filed as
Exhibits 2, 3 and 4 hereto, respectively.

Merger Agreement
- ----------------

          Subject to the terms and conditions of the Merger Agreement, Merger
Sub will be merged with and into Manufacturing Company, with Manufacturing
Company being the surviving corporation of such merger (the "Merger"). At the
Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement) of the Merger, the issued
and outstanding shares of common stock of the Manufacturing Company will be
converted into the right to receive an aggregate of 7,150,000 shares of Common
Stock, $165,550,000 (subject to adjustment as described in the Merger Agreement)
and the right to receive additional payments, not to exceed $45,000,000 over a
five-year period, based on a formula related to annual rail car industry
production levels. Certain of the shares acquired by Management Company may be
placed, but are not required to be kept, in escrow pursuant to an escrow
agreement to be entered into between Management Company and the Issuer.

                                       6

respect to the Issuer, (ii) initiate or solicit the approval of a shareholder

influence the Issuer, (ix) assist or knowingly encourage any third party to take
any of the foregoing actions, or (x) disclose or announce any intention or
arrangement inconsistent with the foregoing.

     During the Standstill Time, unless otherwise specifically provided by the
Merger Agreement, Common Stock beneficially owned by Management Company and
Manufacturing Company are to be voted as recommended by the Issuer's board of
directors. Specific exceptions to this include certain strategic transactions of
the Issuer, such as certain issuances of preferred stock, a disposition of the
Issuer or a substantial part of the Issuer's assets, a recapitalization of the
Issuer or a liquidation of, or consolidation involving, the Issuer.

Stockholder's Agreement
- -----------------------

     The Merger Agreement provides that the Issuer and Management Company will
enter into the Stockholder's Agreement at the Closing (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) of the Merger.

     Taking of Certain

(ii) initiate or solicit the approval of a shareholder proposal with respect to
the Issuer, (iii) act in concert with others with respect to acquiring,
disposing of or voting Voting Securities (as defined in the Stockholder's
Agreement) of the Issuer, (iv) participate in or encourage the formation of any

control of the Issuer, (v) subject any Voting Securities to any arrangement that

Agreement, (vi) seek to place a representative on, or seek the removal of any
member of, Issuer's board, except pursuant to Management Company's right to
designate a nominee for election to the Issuer's board, (vii) call a meeting of
the Issuer's stockholders or sign a written consent authorizing action without a
meeting of the Issuer's stockholders, (viii) solicit or offer to effect certain
changes in the

<PAGE>

structure or business of the Issuer, such as a merger or disposition of material
assets of the Issuer, (ix) seek to control or influence the Issuer (although
this does not prevent Management Company's designee on the board of directors
from seeking to affect decisions of the board of directors), (x) assist or
knowingly encourage a third party to take any of the foregoing actions, or (xi)
disclose or announce any intention or arrangement inconsistent with the
foregoing.

     -----------------

     Unless otherwise specifically permitted by the Stockholder's Agreement,
Voting Securities beneficially owned by Management Company and its Affiliates
(as defined in the Stockholder's Agreement) are to be voted as recommended by
the Issuer's board of directors. Specific exceptions to this include certain
strategic transactions of the Issuer, such as certain issuances of preferred
stock, a disposition of the Issuer or a substantial part of the Issuer's assets,
a recapitalization of the Issuer or a liquidation of, or consolidation
involving, the Issuer.

     Purchase of Additional Common Stock and Certain Issuances
     ---------------------------------------------------------

     Management Company has agreed that during the Standstill Period none of
Management Company or any Related Person (as defined in the Stockholder's
Agreement) or subsequent Holder (as defined in the Stockholder's Agreement) will
acquire or propose to acquire Voting Securities except (i) in connection with
the Merger Agreement, (ii) pursuant to certain distributions made available to
holders of Common Stock generally, (iii) through purchases, in the open market
or privately negotiated transactions, of up to an aggregate number of shares of
Voting Securities which, when added to the shares of Voting Securities owned by
Management Company, the Family Affiliates, the subsequent Holders and their
respective Affiliates and Associates (as defined in the Stockholder's
Agreement), with the exception of shares acquired in connection with item (iv)
of this sentence, would result in such persons owning no more than 19.9% of the
then-outstanding shares of Voting Securities, or (iv) with respect to Management
Company's designee to the Issuer's board, pursuant to director stock option or
similar plans, or as otherwise specifically permitted by the Stockholder's
Agreement. The Standstill Period generally can last from six and one-half to ten
years, depending on various circumstances.

     With certain specified exceptions, Management Company, the Related Persons
and the subsequent Holders may not collectively own more than 19.9% of the then-
outstanding Voting Securities.

     Restrictions on Transfer
     ------------------------

     Management Company has agreed that during the Holding Period (as defined in
the Stockholder's Agreement), it will not transfer or encumber shares of Common
Stock except (i) to a Related Person of Management Company or a Family
Affiliate, each of whom must agree to be

                                       8
<PAGE>

bound by the Stockholder's Agreement, or (ii) to a financial institution in
connection with a loan so long as the pledgee agrees in writing that, upon
transfer of the securities to the pledgee upon any foreclosure or otherwise, the
securities will remain, and the pledgee will become, subject to the restrictions
contained in the Stockholder's Agreement. The Holding Period generally is
anticipated to last for two years following execution of the Stockholder's
Agreement, with certain exceptions provided for in such agreement.

     The Stockholder's Agreement also provides that, generally, after the
Holding Period until the termination of the Standstill Period, none of
Management Company or any subsequent Holder will transfer or encumber its
respective shares of Common Stock except (i) to the Issuer or in a transaction
approved by the Issuer's chief executive officer, (ii) to a Related Person with
respect to Management Company or a Family Affiliate, if such person agrees to be
bound by the Stockholder's Agreement, (iii) pursuant to certain tender or
exchange offers, (iv) to a financial institution in connection with a loan so
long as the pledgee agrees in writing that, upon transfer of the securities to
the pledgee upon any foreclosure or otherwise, the securities will remain, and
the pledgee will become, subject to the restrictions contained in the
Stockholder's Agreement, (v) subject to certain limitations, to a third party
pursuant to (a) an open market "brokers transaction" as permitted by Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (other than clause (k)
thereof), provided the transferor does not know or reasonably believe such
person and such person's Affiliates, or any group of which such person may be a
member, would hold in the aggregate more than 5% of the Issuer's Voting
Securities after such transaction or, if such person is entitled to file a
Schedule 13G, such persons would not hold in the aggregate more than 10% of the
Issuer's Voting Securities after such transaction (any third person who would
hold in excess of the referenced percentages being a "Prohibited Holder"), or
(b) a private placement to a person, other than a Competitor (as defined in the
Stockholder's Agreement) of Issuer, that (y) Management Company or the
subsequent Holder reasonably believes after due inquiry is not a Prohibited
Holder and Management Company or the Prohibited Holder obtains a written
representation to such effect or (z) agrees in writing to be bound by the
Stockholder's Agreement and the Issuer's board approves the transaction, or (vi)
pursuant to an underwritten public offering, in accordance with the Registration
Rights Agreement, in which (a) the managing underwriter agrees to effect a broad
distribution and (b) neither Management Company nor any subsequent Holder knows
or has reasonable grounds to believe transfer will be made to a third party that
is a Competitor or would be a Prohibited Holder.

     Generally, with limited exemptions, neither Management Company nor a
subsequent Holder is permitted to transfer Voting Securities to or encumber
Voting Securities in favor of any Competitor of the Issuer or to a Prohibited
Holder until after the tenth anniversary of the date of the Agreement.

     In most instances, so long as Management Company and any subsequent Holders
collectively own 8% or more of the outstanding Voting Securities, during the
Standstill Period, neither Management Company nor any subsequent Holder may
transfer or encumber greater than 1,000,000 shares of Common Stock in any 12-
month period without first offering the securities to the Issuer for purchase on
terms similar to that under which the securities would be otherwise be sold.

                                       9

     Board of Directors
     ------------------

     After the Closing, and at each annual meeting of stockholders of the Issuer
prior to the termination of the Standstill Period, for so long as Management
Company, the Family Affiliates and the subsequent Holders own in the aggregate
more than 7.5% of the Voting Securities, the Issuer is to take necessary action
to appoint or elect to Issuer's board one designee of Management Company.
Initially, such designee will be Craig J. Duchossois. During the Standstill
Period, for so long as Management Company and the subsequent Holders own in the
aggregate 19.9% of the then outstanding Voting Securities, the holders of a
majority of the shares held by Management Company and the subsequent Holders may
recommend a nominee to fill a vacancy on the board of the Issuer, although the
Issuer is not obligated to nominate such nominee.

     Term
     ----

     The Stockholder's Agreement terminates on the date that the individuals who
as of the date of the agreement constituted Issuer's board (together with any
new directors whose election or appointment by Issuer's board or whose
nomination for election by the Issuer's stockholders was approved by a majority
of the directors then still in office who either were directors at the beginning
of such period or whose election or nomination was previously so approved),
cease to constitute a majority of the directors then in office (excluding any
director elected pursuant to designation by Management Company). Additionally,
the Stockholder's Agreement terminates with respect to a Holder other than
Management Company as of the date such Holder does not own of record or
beneficially any Voting Securities.

Registration Rights Agreement
- -----------------------------

     The Merger Agreement provides that the Issuer and Management Company will
enter into the Registration Rights Agreement at the Closing of the Merger.

     After the second anniversary of the date of the Registration Rights
Agreement, Management Company and its permitted transferees may request, on two
occasions, that the Issuer register shares of Common Stock held by Management
Company and its permitted transferees under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. A request may cover all or part of the shares of Common Stock held by
such person(s), but each request must apply to at least 2,500,000 shares. The
Issuer may postpone such a registration under certain circumstances specified in
the Registration Rights Agreement.

     Additionally, if, at any time after the second anniversary of the date of
the Registration Rights Agreement, the Issuer determines to register shares of
Common Stock for its own account in an Underwritten Public Offering (as defined
in the Registration Rights Agreement) and not in connection with a merger,
acquisition, exchange offer, subscription offer, dividend reinvestment plan or
stock option or other employee benefit plan, Management Company and its
permitted tranferees have the right to have their shares of Common Stock
included in such registration. The number of shares of Common Stock that
Management Company and its permitted transferees may have so registered may be
limited, pursuant to certain procedures, if the

                                       10
<PAGE>

managing underwriter concludes that inclusion of all or part of such shares
would materially adversely affect such offering.

     The Registration Rights Agreement contains certain provisions regarding
registration procedures to be followed, indemnification and holdback
arrangements. Transfer of the rights under the agreement are subject to certain
limitations. The rights granted under the agreement terminate, with respect to
each Holder (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement), when all shares
of Registrable Securities (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) held
by such Holder may immediately be sold under Rule 144 during any 90-day period.
