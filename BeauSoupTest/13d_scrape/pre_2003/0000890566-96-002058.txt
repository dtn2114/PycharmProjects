            2.4.1. REVOLVING NOTE. The Revolving Loans shall be evidenced by the
      Revolving Note, jointly and severally executed by the Borrowers, dated the
      date of this Agreement, payable to the Bank on the Revolving Note Maturity
      Date (unless sooner accelerated pursuant to the terms of this Agreement),
      and in the principal amount of the original Commitment Amount. The date
      and amount of each Revolving Loan made by the Bank and of each prepayment
      or repayment of principal thereon received by the Bank shall be recorded
      by the Bank in its records or, at the option of the Bank, on a schedule
      attached to the Revolving Note. The aggregate unpaid principal amount so
      recorded by the Bank shall constitute the best evidence of the principal
      amount owing and unpaid on the Revolving Note, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the
      failure by the Bank to so record any such amount or any error in so
      recording any such amount (whether on the schedule attached to the
      Revolving Note or otherwise) shall not limit or otherwise affect the
      obligations of the Borrowers under this Agreement or the Revolving Note to
      repay the principal amount of all the Revolving Loans together with all
      interest accrued or accruing thereon.

            2.4.2. TERM NOTE. The Term Loan shall be evidenced by the Term Note.

      2.5.  INTEREST; PAYMENTS.

            2.5.1. REVOLVING NOTE. Subject to the provisions of SECTION 2.6
      below, prior to and on the Revolving Loan Maturity Date, the Revolving
      Note shall bear interest on the outstanding principal balance from time to
      time outstanding at the rate or rates provided in the Interest Rate Annex.
      Accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid principal balance of the
      Revolving Note shall be due and payable on the Interest Payment Dates (as
      defined in the Interest Rate Annex) and the principal of the Revolving
      Note shall be due and payable in full on the Revolving Note Maturity Date;
      PROVIDED, that the Borrowers shall also make the principal prepayments on
      the Revolving Note provided under SECTION 2.9.

            2.5.2. TERM NOTE. Subject to the provisions of SECTION 2.6 below,
      the Term Note shall bear interest on the outstanding principal balance
      from time to time outstanding under the Term Note at a rate or rates
      provided in the Interest Rate Annex. Accrued and unpaid interest on the
      unpaid principal balance of the Term Note shall be due and payable on the
      Interest Payment Dates (as defined in the Interest Rate Annex). The
      principal of the Term Note shall be due and payable in monthly
      installments of $87,500 each, the first of such principal installments to
      be due and payable on February 1, 1997, and a like principal installment
      to be due and payable on the first day of each succeeding calendar month
      occurring thereafter until the Term Note has been fully paid and
      satisfied; PROVIDED, that on the Term Note Maturity Date, all then
      outstanding principal on the Term Note and all accrued and unpaid interest
      thereon shall be finally due and payable.

            2.5.3. GENERAL PROVISIONS. Except to the extent otherwise provided
      herein, all payments of principal, interest and other amounts to be paid
      by the Borrowers to the Bank hereunder, under the Notes and the other Loan
      Documents shall be made in Dollars, in immediately available funds.

      2.6. MAXIMUM RATE. The following provisions shall control this Agreement
and the Notes:

            (a) No agreements, conditions, provision or stipulations contained
      in this Agreement, any Note, any of the other Loan Documents or in any
      other agreement between any Borrower and the Bank, or the occurrence of an
      Event of Default, or the exercise by the Bank of the right to accelerate
      the payment of the maturity of principal and interest, or to exercise any
      option whatsoever contained in this Agreement or any other agreement
      between the Borrowers and the Bank, or the arising of any contingency
      whatsoever, shall entitle the Bank to collect, in any event, interest
      exceeding the maximum rate of nonusurious interest allowed from time to
      time by applicable state or federal laws as now or as may hereinafter be
      in effect (the "MAXIMUM LEGAL RATE") and in no event shall the Borrowers
      be obligated to pay interest exceeding such Maximum Legal Rate, and all
      agreements, conditions or stipulations, if any, which may in any event or
      contingency whatsoever operate to bind, obligate or compel any Related
      Party to pay a rate of interest exceeding the Maximum Legal Rate shall be
      without binding force or effect, at law or in equity, to the extent only
      of the excess of interest over such Maximum Legal Rate. In the event any
      interest is charged in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate (the "EXCESS"),
      each Borrower acknowledges and stipulates that any such charge shall be
      the result of an accidental and bona fide error, and such Excess shall be,
      first, applied to reduce the principal of any obligations due, and,
      second, returned to the Borrowers, it being the intention of the parties
      hereto not to enter at any time into an usurious or otherwise illegal
      relationship. The parties hereto recognize that with fluctuations in the
      Prime Rate from time to time announced by the Bank such an unintentional
      result could inadvertently occur. By the execution of this Agreement, each
      Borrower covenants that the credit or return of any Excess shall
      constitute the acceptance by any Borrower of such Excess, and no Borrower
      shall seek or pursue any other remedy, legal or equitable, against the
      Bank based, in whole or in part, upon the charging or receiving of any
      interest in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate. For the purpose of
      determining whether or not any Excess has been contracted for, charged or
      received by the Bank, all interest at any time contracted for, charged or
      received by the Bank in connection with the Borrowers' obligations shall
      be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts during the
      entire term of this Agreement. If at any time the rate of interest payable
      hereunder with respect to any Note shall be computed for such Note on the
      basis of the Maximum Legal Rate, any subsequent reduction in the Contract
      Rate shall not reduce such interest thereafter payable hereunder

                                      14
<PAGE>
      with respect to such Note below the amount computed on the basis of the
      Maximum Legal Rate until the aggregate amount of such interest accrued and
      payable under this Agreement equals the total amount of interest which
      would have accrued if such interest had been at all times computed solely
      on the basis of the Contract Rate for such Note.

            (b) Unless preempted by federal law, the rate of interest from time
      to time in effect hereunder shall not exceed the "INDICATED RATE CEILING"
      from time to time in effect under Chapter 1 of the Texas Credit Code
      (Vernon's Texas Civil Statutes), Section (a)(1), Article 5069-1.04, as
      amended.

            (c) The provisions of this Section shall be deemed to be
      incorporated into every document or communication relating to the
      Indebtedness which sets forth or prescribes any account, right or claims
      or alleged account, right or claim of the Bank with respect to any
      Borrower (or any other Related Party in respect of the Indebtedness),
      whether or not any provisions of this Section are referred to therein. All
      such documents and communications and all figures set forth therein shall,
      for the sole purpose of computing the extent of the obligations asserted
      by the Bank thereunder, be automatically recomputed by any Borrower or any
      other Related Party, and by any court considering the same, to give effect
      to the adjustments or credits required by this Section.

            (d) If the applicable state or federal law is amended in the future
      to allow a greater rate of interest to be charged under this Agreement
      than is presently allowed by applicable state or federal law, then the
      limitation of interest hereunder shall be increased to the maximum rate of
      interest allowed by applicable state or federal law, as amended, which
      increase shall be effective hereunder on the effective date of such
      amendment, and all interest charges owing to the Bank by reason thereof
      shall be payable upon demand.

            (e) The provisions of Chapter 15 of the Texas Credit Code (Vernon's
      Texas Civil Statutes), Article 5069-15, as amended, are specifically
      declared by the parties hereto not to be applicable to this Agreement or
      any of the other agreements executed in connection herewith or therewith
      or to the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

      2.7.  FEES.

            2.7.1. PREPARATION FEES. Simultaneously with the execution of this
      Agreement, the Borrowers, jointly and severally, shall pay to the Bank the
      reasonable amount of third party expenses (including reasonable attorney's
      fees and disbursements) incurred by the Bank in connection with the
      preparation of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

            2.7.2. COMMITMENT FEE. Borrowers shall pay to Bank a commitment fee
      for the period from the date of this Agreement to and including the
      Revolving Note Maturity Date

                                      15

<PAGE>
      equal to 0.25% per annum on the average daily excess of the Commitment
      Amount over the aggregate unpaid principal balance of the Revolving Loans.
      Such commitment fee shall be payable in arrears on the first Business Day
      on each April, July, October and January occurring after the date hereof
      (beginning with March 1997), and on the Revolving Note Maturity Date, for
      the periods ending on such date.

            2.7.3. FACILITY FEE. Simultaneously with the execution of this
      Agreement, the Borrowers, jointly and severally, shall pay to the Bank the
      remaining balance owing on the $15,000 facility fee owing by the Borrowers
      to the Bank.

      2.8. BASIS OF COMPUTATION. The amount of all accrued interest and fees
hereunder and under the Notes shall be computed for the actual number of days
elapsed in a year consisting of 360 days, unless the Maximum Legal Rate would
thereby be exceeded, in which event, to the extent necessary to avoid exceeding
the Maximum Legal Rate, interest shall be computed on the basis of the actual
number of days elapsed in the applicable calendar year in which accrued.

      2.9.  MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS.

            2.9.1. BORROWING BASE VIOLATIONS. The Borrowers, jointly and
      severally, shall pay to the Bank the amount, if any, by which the
      aggregate unpaid principal amount of all Revolving Loans from time to time
      exceeds the Borrowing Base, together with all interest accrued and unpaid
      on the amount of such excess, but without other premium or penalty. Such
      prepayment shall be immediately due and owing upon the occurrence of any
      such excess. Such prepayments shall be applied first to the accrued and
      unpaid interest owing under Prime Rate Borrowings under the Revolving
      Note, then to the accrued and unpaid interest owing under Eurodollar Rate
      Borrowings under the Revolving Note, and the balance to principal of the
      Revolving Note.

            2.9.2. EFFECTS ON EURODOLLAR BORROWINGS. It is specifically noted
      that the prepayment of any outstanding amounts or tranches subject to
      fixed rate financing by the Bank, including but not limited to Eurodollar
      Borrowings (as defined in the Interest Rate Annex), may result in the
      incurring by the Borrowers of prepayment penalties and/or other costs. The
      fact that a mandatory prepayment is effected with respect to any fixed
      rate or Eurodollar Borrowings shall not operate to relieve any Borrower of
      its obligations to pay such penalties and/or costs (if any).

      2.10. OPTIONAL REDUCTIONS IN COMMITMENT AMOUNT. The Borrowers shall have
the right to terminate or reduce the Commitment Amount at any time or from time
to time, PROVIDED that (a) the Borrowers shall give notice of each such
termination or reduction to the Bank not less than three (3) days prior to any
such notice and (ii) each such partial reduction shall be in an aggregate

                                      16

<PAGE>
amount of at least $250,000. Any termination or reduction of the Commitment
Amount may not be reinstated without the written approval of the Bank granted in
its sole and absolute discretion.

      2.11. LOCKBOX; DOMINION OF FUNDS. Each Borrower shall cause its account
debtors to make payments to such Borrower in care of a lock box account to be
established with Bank prior to the initial Disbursement Date. Each Borrower
agrees to collect and enforce payment of all Accounts until an Event of Default
has occurred hereunder, and then only after Bank directs such Borrower to the
contrary and, from and after such direction, such Borrower agrees to fully and
promptly cooperate with and assist Bank (or any other person as Bank may
designate) in the collection and enforcement of all Accounts. Immediately upon
notice to such effect by Bank to any Borrower and at all times thereafter, such
Borrower shall (a) endorse to Bank and forthwith deliver to Bank all payments
received by such Borrower on Accounts or from the sale of any Inventory or
arising from any other rights or interests of such Borrower therein, in the form
received by such Borrower without commingling with any funds belonging to any
Borrower, and (b) forthwith deliver to Bank all such property in such Borrower's
possession or hereafter coming into such Borrower's possession through any
enforcement of any such rights or interests. All payments so received by Bank
shall be applied in payment of the Indebtedness, first to Bank's costs and
expenses incurred under this Agreement or any document executed in connection
herewith, then to interest on the Notes, then to principal of the Notes in such
manner as the Bank may elect in its sole discretion (in inverse order of their
maturities if principal amounts are due in installments), then to other
Indebtedness. The surplus, if any, shall be paid over to such Borrower.

      2.12. BASIS OF PAYMENTS; APPLICATION. All sums payable by any Borrower to
the Bank under this agreement shall be paid directly to the Bank at its
principal office in Dollars in immediately available funds, without setoff,
deduction or counterclaim. In its sole discretion, the Bank may charge any and
all deposit or other accounts (including without limitation, an account
evidenced by a certificate of deposit) of any Borrower with the Bank for all or
part of the Indebtedness then due; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that this authorization
shall not affect any Borrower's obligation to pay, when due, any Indebtedness
whether or not account balances are sufficient to pay amounts due. All payments
shall be applied first to interest, the balance to principal.

SECTION 3.  SECURITY.

      To secure full and timely performance of each Borrower's covenants set out
in this Agreement and to secure the repayment of the Notes and all other
Indebtedness whatsoever of the Borrowers to the Bank, each Borrower agrees to
grant and assign a lien upon and security interest in the Collateral pursuant to
the Security Documents and other instruments and agreements satisfactory to the
Bank.

expended by the Bank.

to or measured by reference to loans made or to be made hereunder or
participations therein, and the result shall be to increase the cost to the Bank
or any of the Bank's affiliates of making or maintaining any loan hereunder or
to any other party maintaining any participation therein, or reduce any amount
receivable in respect of any such loan (which increase in cost, or reduction in
amount receivable, shall be the result of the Bank's or the Bank's affiliated
company's reasonable allocation among all affected customers of the aggregate of
such increases or reductions resulting from such event), then, within thirty
(30) days after receipt by the Borrowers of a certificate from the Bank
containing the information described in this Section below which shall be
delivered to the Borrowers, the Borrowers agree from time to time to pay the
Bank such additional amounts as shall be sufficient to compensate the Bank or
any of the Bank's affiliates (for as long as such increased costs or reductions
in amount receivable exist) for such increased costs or reductions in amount
receivable which the Bank determines in the Bank's sole reasonable discretion
are material. The certificate requesting compensation under this Section shall
identify the regulatory change which has occurred, the requirements which have
been

                                      40

imposed, modified or deemed applicable, the amount of such additional cost or
reduction in amount receivable and the way in which such amount has been
calculated.

      9.13. COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. If the Bank retains an attorney in
connection with any Default or to collect, enforce or defend this Agreement, any
of the Notes or any of the Loan Documents in any lawsuit or in any probate,
reorganization, bankruptcy or other proceeding, or if any Borrower sues the Bank
in connection with this Agreement, any of the Notes or any of the Loan Documents
and does not prevail, then each Borrower agrees to pay to the Bank, in addition
to principal and interest, all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the
Bank in trying to collect any of the Notes or any of the Debt or in any such
suit or proceeding, including reasonable attorneys' fees. To the extent not
prohibited by applicable law or otherwise provided herein, the Borrowers will
pay, jointly and severally, immediately upon demand, all reasonable costs and
expenses and reimburse the Bank for any and all reasonable expenditures of every
character incurred or expended from time to time, regardless of whether or not a
Default has occurred, in connection with (a) the preparation, negotiation,
documentation, closing, renewal, revision, modification, increase, review or
restructuring of this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents including,
without limitation, legal, accounting, auditing, or in connection with
collecting or attempting to enforce or collect this Agreement, any of the Notes
or any of the other Loan Documents, (b) the Bank's evaluating, monitoring,
administrating and protecting any Collateral now or hereafter securing payment
of any part of the Indebtedness and (c) the Bank's creating, perfecting and
realizing upon the Bank's security interests in and liens on any Collateral, and
all reasonable costs and expenses relating to the Bank's exercising any of its
rights and remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or at law,
including, without limitation, all reasonable appraisal fees, consulting fees,
filing fees, taxes, brokerage fees and commissions, title review and abstract
fees, UCC search fees, other fees and expenses incident to title searches,
reports and security interests, escrow fees, attorneys' fees, legal expenses,
court costs, other fees and expenses incurred in connection with any complete or
partial liquidation of any Collateral and all reasonable fees and expenses for
any professional services relating to the Collateral or any operations conducted
in connection with it; PROVIDED, that no right or option granted by the
Borrowers to the Bank or otherwise arising pursuant to any provision of this or
any other instrument shall be deemed to impose or admit a duty on the Bank to
supervise, monitor or control any aspect of the character or condition of the
Collateral or any operations conducted in connection with it for the benefit of
the Borrowers or any other Person other than the Bank. Each Borrower agrees to
indemnify, defend and hold the Bank, its shareholders, directors, officers,
agents and employees (collectively "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") harmless from and
against any and all loss, liability, obligation, damage, penalty, judgment,
claim, deficiency, expense, action, suit, cost and disbursement of any kind or
nature whatsoever (including interest, penalties, attorneys' fees and amounts
paid in settlement), REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE
NEGLIGENCE OF ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED PARTIES, imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Indemnified Parties growing out of or resulting from this
Agreement, any Note, any other Loan Document or any transaction or event
contemplated herein

                                      41

<PAGE>
or therein (except that such indemnity shall not be paid to any Indemnified
Party to the extent that such loss, etc. directly results from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnified Party). Any amount to be
paid under this Section by any Borrower to the Bank shall be a demand obligation
owing by such Borrower to the Bank and shall bear interest from the date of
expenditure until paid at the Past Due Rate.

      9.14. GENDER. Throughout this Agreement, the masculine shall include the
feminine and vice versa and the singular shall include the plural and vice
versa, unless the context of this Agreement indicates otherwise.

      9.15. CROSS DEFAULT; CROSS COLLATERAL. Each Borrower hereby agrees that
all other agreements between the Borrowers and the Bank or any of its affiliates
is hereby amended so that a default under this Agreement is a default under all
other agreements and a default under any one of the other agreements is a
default under this Agreement, and the collateral under this Agreement secures
the obligations now or hereafter outstanding under all other agreements between
the Borrowers and the Bank or any of its affiliates and the collateral pledged
under any other agreement with the Bank or any of its affiliates secures the
obligations under this Agreement.

      9.16. JOINT AND SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS. The Borrowers shall be jointly and
severally liable for the payment and performance of the Indebtedness without
regard to which Borrower receives the proceeds hereof. Each Borrower hereby
acknowledges that it expects to derive economic advantage from each of the
Loans.

      9.17. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. Any provision of this Agreement, any
Note or any other Loan Documents that is prohibited or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement, such Note or such other documents or affecting the
validity or enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction.

      9.18. ASSIGNMENT. The Bank shall have the absolute and unrestricted right
to sell, assign, transfer, or grant participation in, all or any portion of the
Loans and any collateral, guaranties or other security relating thereto without
the consent of the Borrowers; PROVIDED, however, no such action on the part of
the Bank shall have the effect of changing any Borrower's obligations hereunder
without the written consent of such Borrower. The Bank shall give the Borrowers
written notice of any absolute assignment of any of the Loans if the result
thereof will be to cause the Borrowers to deal directly with another financial
institution which is not the successor in interest by merger to the Bank.

      9.19. VENUE. The Borrowers hereby irrevocably (a) agree that any legal
proceeding against the Bank arising out of or in connection with the Loan
Documents shall be brought in the district courts of Dallas County, Texas, or in
the United States District Court for the Northern

                                      42

<PAGE>
District of Texas, Dallas Division (collectively, the "DALLAS COURTS"); (b)
submits to the non-exclusive jurisdiction of the Dallas Courts; (c) agrees and
consents that service of process may be made upon it in any proceeding arising
out of the Loan Documents or any transaction contemplated thereby by service of
process as provided by Texas law; (d) WAIVES, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of
any suit, action or proceeding arising out of any Loan Document or the
transactions contemplated thereby in the Dallas Courts; and (e) WAIVES any claim
that any such suit, action or proceeding in any Dallas Court has been brought in
an inconvenient forum. All of the obligations of the Borrowers under the Loan
Documents are performable in Dallas County, Texas. Nothing herein shall affect
the right of the Bank to commence legal proceedings or otherwise proceed against
any Borrower in any jurisdiction or to serve process in any manner permitted by
applicable law. Each Borrower agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions in any
manner provided by law.

PROCEEDINGS AT ANY TIME IN WHICH SUCH BORROWER AND BANK ARE PARTIES ARISING OUT

                             SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT
                      (St. James Capital Partners, L.P.)

      THIS SUBORDINATION AGREEMENT ("AGREEMENT") is dated effective as of
December 5, 1996. The parties to it are ST. JAMES CAPITAL PARTNERS, L.P.
("SUBORDINATE CREDITOR"), a Delaware limited partnership, HERLIN INDUSTRIES,

RECITALS:

      A. Of even date herewith, the Herlin is executing and delivering to
Subordinate Creditor a promissory note of even date herewith (which, as it may
have been renewed, extended or rearranged is called the "SUBORDINATE NOTE"), in
the original principal sum of Three Million Dollars ($3,000,000). A true,
correct and complete copy of the Subordinate Note is attached hereto as EXHIBIT
A and incorporated herein by reference for all purposes. All liens, security
interests and assignments now or hereafter securing payment or performance of
the Subordinate Note are herein called the "SUBORDINATE LIENS."

      B. The Borrowers and Senior Creditor have entered into the Credit
Agreement pursuant to which, among other things, Senior Creditor has established
a $9,800,000 revolving and term loan facility in favor of the Borrowers. In
addition, pursuant to the Credit Agreement, the Borrowers executed and delivered
to Senior Creditor the Notes. All capitalized terms used herein and not defined
herein shall have the meanings herein assigned to them in the Credit Agreement.
All liens, security interests and assignments now or hereafter securing payment
or performance of the Indebtedness under the Credit Agreement are herein called
the "SENIOR LIENS."

      C. Senior Creditor has required that the Subordinate Liens be subordinated
to the Senior Liens.

succeeding provisions of this Agreement (which shall control over any
conflicting or inconsistent recitals above).



                                      1

<PAGE>
AGREEMENTS:

      In consideration of the premises and the mutual agreements herein set
forth, Borrowers, Subordinate Creditor and Senior Creditor hereby agree as
follows:

      1. As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the
respective meanings indicated:

      (a)   SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS shall mean all indebtedness now or hereafter
            secured by any ------------------- of the Senior Liens, including,
            without limitation, all of the Indebtedness. The Senior Indebtedness
            shall include amounts accruing subsequent to the filing of any
            bankruptcy, receivership, insolvency or like petition. Without
            limiting the generality of the foregoing, Senior Indebtedness shall
            include all obligations for fees, to indemnify, to reimburse for
            expenses and to reimburse for advances (whether for the payment of
            taxes, insurance premiums, the preservation or protection of
            property or the title thereto or for any other reason).

      (b)   SUBORDINATED INDEBTEDNESS shall mean all indebtedness now or
            hereafter secured by any of the Subordinate Liens, including,
            without limitation, all indebtedness evidenced by the Subordinate
            Note and all renewals, extensions, rearrangements, refundings and
            modifications of the Subordinate Note permitted by Senior Creditor,
            and all indebtedness and obligations arising under or incurred
            pursuant to any other documents executed or delivered in connection
            therewith.

      2. Unless and until all Senior Indebtedness shall have been fully paid and
satisfied and the obligation of Senior Creditor to make any further loans or
advances to Borrowers shall have ceased and terminated, Subordinate Creditor
will not (a) ask, demand, sue for, take or receive, or retain, from Borrowers or
any other person or entity, by setoff or in any other manner, payment of all or
any part of the Subordinated Indebtedness, (b) ask, demand or receive any
security for the Subordinated Indebtedness, (c) amend the Subordinate Note or
any other document existing in connection with the Subordinated Indebtedness, or
(d) declare the Subordinated Indebtedness due and payable by reason of any
default or for any other reason, or bring or join with any creditor in bringing
any proceeding against Borrowers under any bankruptcy, reorganization,
readjustment or arrangement of debt, suspension of payments, receivership,
liquidation or insolvency or similar law or statute now or hereafter in effect
("PROCEEDINGS"). Subordinate Creditor hereby directs Borrowers to make, and
Borrowers hereby agree to make, such prior payment of the Senior Indebtedness to
Senior Creditor.

      3. (a) Upon any distribution of the assets of Borrowers in connection with
any dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization of Borrowers (whether
in Proceedings or upon an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other
marshalling of the assets and liabilities of Borrowers or otherwise), Senior
Creditor shall first be entitled to receive payment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness before Subordinate Creditor shall be entitled to receive any
payment in respect of the Subordinated Indebtedness. Upon any such dissolution,
winding up, liquidation or reorganization, any payment or distribution of assets
of Borrowers of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities,
to which Subordinate Creditor would be entitled except for the provisions of
this Agreement (including any such payment or distribution which may be payable
or deliverable by virtue of the provisions of any securities which are
subordinated as junior in right of payment to the Subordinated Indebtedness)
shall be made by the liquidating trustee or agent or other persons making such
payment or distribution (whether a trustee in bankruptcy, a receiver or
liquidating trustee or otherwise) (a "PAYING PARTY"), or if received by
Subordinate Creditor, by Subordinate Creditor, directly to Senior Creditor, to
the extent necessary to pay in full the Senior Indebtedness remaining unpaid,
after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to Senior
Creditor. Subordinate Creditor hereby authorizes and directs each Paying Party
to pay over to Senior Creditor upon demand by Senior Creditor, all such payments
or distributions without the necessity of any inquiry as to the status or
balance of the Senior Indebtedness, and without further notice to or consent of
Subordinate Creditor. In furtherance of the foregoing, but not by way of
limitation thereof, in the event Borrowers are subject to any Proceeding, with
the result that Borrowers are excused from the obligation to pay all or part of
the interest otherwise payable in respect of the Senior Indebtedness during the
period subsequent to the commencement of any such Proceeding, Subordinate
Creditor agrees that all or such part of such interest, as the case may be,
shall be payable out of, and to that extent diminish and be at the expense of,
reorganization dividends or distributions in respect of the Subordinated
Indebtedness.

            (b) Subordinate Creditor hereby irrevocably authorizes and empowers
Senior Creditor to demand, sue for, collect and receive every such payment or
distribution and give acquittance therefor, to execute, sign, endorse, transfer
and deliver any and all receipts and instruments, and to file claims and take
such other proceedings, all in the name of Subordinate Creditor, or otherwise,
as Senior Creditor may deem necessary or advisable for the enforcement of this
Agreement, but Senior Creditor has no obligation to do so. Subordinate Creditor
hereby agrees duly and promptly to take such action as may be required by Senior
Creditor to collect the Subordinated Indebtedness for the account of Senior
Creditor and/or to file appropriate proofs of claim in respect of the
Subordinated Indebtedness.

            (c) In the event any payment or distribution of assets of Borrowers
of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, and whether
or not pursuant to any dis solution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization,
not permitted by or in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement shall be
received by Subordinate Creditor, such payment or distri bution to Subordinate
Creditor shall not be commingled with other funds and shall be held in trust for
the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, Senior Creditor, or to
its representative, in precisely the form received (except for the endorsement
or assignment of Subordinate Creditor where necessary). In the event of any
failure by Subordinate Creditor to make any such endorsement or assignment,
Senior Creditor is hereby irrevocably authorized to make same.

                                      3
<PAGE>
            (d) The provisions of this Agreement are and are intended solely for
the purpose of defining the relative rights of Subordinate Creditor and Senior
Creditor, and are solely for the benefit of Senior Creditor and may not be
relied upon or enforced by any party other than Senior Creditor, and nothing
contained in this Agreement is intended to or shall impair the obligation of
Borrowers, which is unconditional and absolute, to pay to Subordinate Creditor
the principal of and interest on the Subordinated Indebtedness as and when the
same shall become due and payable in accordance with its terms, or to affect the
relative rights of Subordinate Creditor and creditors of Borrowers other than
Senior Creditor.

            (e) Senior Creditor may, at any time and from time to time, without
the consent of or notice to Subordinate Creditor, and without impairing or
releasing the obligations of Subordinate Creditor hereunder (i) change the
manner, place or terms of payment or change or extend the time of payment of, or
renew or alter, the Senior Indebtedness or the security therefor, or otherwise
amend in any manner the Credit Agreement or any document executed in connection
therewith; (ii) exercise or refrain from exercising any rights against Borrowers
and others; (iii) apply any sums by whomsoever paid or however realized to the
Senior Indebtedness; (iv) sell, exchange, release, surrender, realize upon or
otherwise deal with in any manner and in any order any property whatsoever and
by whomsoever at any time pledged or mortgaged to secure, or howsoever securing,
any Senior Indebtedness; (v) release anyone liable in any manner for the payment
or collection of any Senior Indebtedness; and (vi) settle or compromise all or
any part of the Senior Indebtedness, and subordinate the payment of any part of
the Senior Indebtedness to the payment of any other indebtedness (including any
other part of the Senior Indebtedness). No invalidity, irregularity or
unenforceability of all or any part of the Senior Indebtedness or of any of the
Senior Liens shall affect, impair or be a defense to this Agreement.

      4. Subordinate Creditor represents and warrants that no liens, security
interests or assignments exist to secure any Subordinated Indebtedness other
than the Permitted Subordinated Liens, and agrees that no further liens,
security interests or assignments will arise or will be taken in the future to
secure any Subordinated Indebtedness. Without limiting the foregoing,
Subordinate Creditor hereby agrees (a) that Subordinate Creditor will not
enforce the Subordinate Liens without the prior written consent of Senior
Creditor and (b) that the Subordinate Liens, to the extent enforceable, will be
enforceable by Senior Creditor. All amounts, whether in the form of cash,
proceeds, checks, drafts, orders or other instruments for the payment of money,
recovered with respect to any property of Borrowers subject to the Subordinate
Liens by the enforcement of the Subordinate Liens shall immediately upon receipt
thereof by Subordinate Creditor be paid over and delivered in the form received,
but with any necessary endorsements or instruments required for payment to
Senior Creditor, and, until so delivered shall not be commingled with any other
funds or property but shall be held by Subordinate Creditor upon an express
trust for the benefit of Senior Creditor.

      5. Subordinate Creditor does hereby expressly subordinate and make second,
junior and inferior any and all liens, rights, powers, titles and interests of
Subordinate Creditor under,

                                      4
<PAGE>
pursuant to or by virtue of the Subordinate Liens to all liens, rights, titles
and interests of Senior Creditor under, pursuant to or by virtue of the Senior
Liens, and Subordinate Creditor agrees that all liens, rights, titles and
interests of the Senior Liens shall be unconditionally first, prior and superior
to any and all liens, rights, powers, titles and interests of Subordinate
Creditor under, pursuant to or by virtue of the Subordinate Liens. Subordinate
Creditor further agrees that any and all liens, rights, titles and interests of
Subordinate Creditor under, pursuant to or by virtue of the Subordinate Liens
shall be and remain expressly subject and subordinate to any renewal, extension,
refinancing, consolidation, modification or supplement of the liens, rights,
titles and interests of the Senior Liens, as well as any and all increases
thereof.

      6. Subordinate Creditor, its successors or assigns or any other legal
holder of the Subordinated Indebtedness shall not acquire by subrogation,
contract or otherwise any lien upon or other estate, right or interest in any
property (including but not limited to any which may arise in respect to real
estate taxes, assessments or other governmental charges) which is or may be
prior in right to the Senior Liens or any renewal, extension, refinancing,
consolidation, modification or supplement thereof.

      7. Subordinate Creditor, its successors or assigns or any other legal
holder of the Subordinated Indebtedness hereby assigns and releases to the legal
holder of the Senior Indebtedness:

      (a)   all of its right, title, interest or claim, if any, in and to the
            proceeds of all policies of insurance covering any property for
            application upon the indebtedness secured by or other disposition
            thereof in accordance with the provisions of the Senior Liens;

      (b)   all of its right, title and interest or claim, if any, in and to all
            awards or other compensation made for any taking of any part of any
            property covered by the Senior Liens to be applied upon the
            indebtedness secured by or disposed of in accordance with the
            provisions of the Senior Liens.

In the event that following any such application and disposition of the
insurance proceeds and condemnation award and other compensation, any balance
remains, then, except as Borrowers and Subordinate Creditor may otherwise agree,
such excess shall be made payable to the joint order of Subordinate Creditor and
Borrowers or their successors or assigns.

      8. The Subordinate Liens shall be and the same are hereby are and shall
continue subject and subordinate to any and all leases upon all or any part of
any property covered by the Senior Liens and to which the Senior Liens shall now
be or shall hereafter have been made subject and subordinate.

      9. Subordinate Creditor represents to Senior Creditor that the
Subordinated Indebtedness is in good standing and in full force and effect and
no breaches or defaults exist

                                      5
<PAGE>
thereunder which have not been cured or waived, that no accrued interest on the
Subordinate Note has been paid, and that the outstanding principal balance of
the Subordinate Note on this date is $3,000,000.

      10. This Agreement extends to and covers all amounts due on the Senior
Indebtedness both before and after and filing of any Proceeding by or against
Borrowers, and Senior Creditor shall be entitled to amounts accruing on the
Senior Indebtedness from the date of filing of said Proceeding to the date of
full and final payment of the Senior Indebtedness.

      11. Senior Creditor and Borrower acknowledge and agree that the
Subordinate Note and any and all other instruments evidencing or securing the
Secured Indebtedness may be transferred and assigned, in whole or in part,
PROVIDED, that (a) Subordinate Creditor has first given Senior Creditor ten (10)
days' prior written notice of any such assignment or transfer specifying the
name, address and contact person of any such transferee or assignee
(collectively, an "ASSIGNEE"), and (b) the proposed Assignee has executed and
delivered to Senior Creditor an agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to Senior Creditor pursuant to which such Assignee acknowledges,
ratifies, confirms and agrees that the Subordinate Note and any other instrument
evidencing or securing the Subordinated Indebtedness are second and subordinate
to the Senior Indebtedness and are expressly made subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement and, further, that any subsequent transfer or
assignment of the Subordinate Note or any of the other Subordinated Indebtedness
shall be subject to the terms and provisions. Any instrument evidencing the
Subordinated Indebtedness will contain provisions referring specifically to this
Agreement.

      12. In the event of a breach by any party hereto of any of the provisions
of this Agreement, or in the event any representation or warranty contained

holders of this note, to the exclusion of all prior holders not then retaining
or reserving an interest in this note, to the end that all the rights, powers,
remedies, liens, benefits and privileges accruing and to accrue hereunder to

and held by the holder or holders of this note

                             Page 1 of 7 Pages

<PAGE>
from time to time, whether such holder acquires this note through succession to

      (e) "STATED RATE" means, on any day, the rate per annum as provided in
Section 2.5 of the Loan Agreement for interest on principal of this note, not to

      2. LOAN AGREEMENT; ADVANCES; SECURITY. This note has been issued pursuant
to the terms of the Loan Agreement, and is the Revolving Note referred to in the
Loan Agreement. Advances against this note by Payee or other holder hereof shall
be governed by the terms and provisions of the Loan Agreement. Reference is
hereby made to the Loan Agreement for all purposes. Payee is entitled to the
benefits of and security provided for in the Loan Agreement. The unpaid
principal balance of this note at any time shall be the total of all amounts
lent or advanced against this note less the amount of all payments or permitted
prepayments made on this note and by or for the account of Makers. All loans and
advances and all payments and permitted prepayments made hereon may be endorsed
by the holder of this note on a schedule which may be attached hereto (and
thereby made a part hereof for all purposes) or otherwise recorded in the
holder's records; PROVIDED, that any failure to make notation of (a) any advance
shall not cancel, limit or otherwise affect any Maker's obligations or any
holder's rights with respect to that advance, or (b) any payment or permitted
prepayment of principal shall not cancel, limit or otherwise affect any Maker's
entitlement to credit for that payment as of the date received by the holder.

      3. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Interest on the amount of each advance against
this note shall be computed on the amount of that advance and from the date it
is made.

      4. MANDATORY PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. Accrued and unpaid
interest on the unpaid principal balance of this note shall be due and payable
as provided in Section 2.5.1 of the Loan Agreement. In addition, the principal
of this note, together with accrued and then unpaid interest on the unpaid
principal balance of this note, shall be finally due and payable on the
Revolving Note Maturity Date.

      5. NO USURY INTENDED; SPREADING. Reference is hereby made to Section 2.6
of the Loan Agreement, which is incorporated herein and hereby made a part
hereof. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this note or
any of the other Loan Documents, it is expressly provided that in no case or
event shall the aggregate of (i) all interest on the unpaid balance of this
note, accrued or paid from the date hereof and (ii) the aggregate of any other
amounts accrued or paid pursuant to this note or any of the other Loan
Documents, which under applicable laws are or may be deemed to constitute
interest upon the indebtedness evidenced by this note from the date hereof, ever
exceed the Maximum Legal Rate. In this connection, Makers and Payee stipulate
and agree that it is their common and overriding intent to contract in strict
compliance with applicable usury laws. In furtherance thereof, none of the terms
of this note or

                             Page 2 of 7 Pages
<PAGE>
any of the other Loan Documents shall ever be construed to create a contract to
pay, as consider ation for the use, forbearance or detention of money, interest
at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate. Any Maker or other parties now or
hereafter becoming liable for payment of the indebtedness evidenced by this note
shall never be liable for interest in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate. If, for
any reason whatever, the interest paid or received on this note during its full
term produces a rate which exceeds the Maximum Legal Rate, the holder of this
note shall credit against the principal of this note (or, if such indebtedness
shall have been paid in full, shall refund to the payor of such interest) such
portion of said interest as shall be necessary to cause the interest paid on
this note to produce a rate equal to the Maximum Legal Rate. All sums paid or
agreed to be paid to the holder of this note for the use, forbearance or
detention of the indebtedness evidenced hereby shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be amortized, prorated, allocated and spread in equal parts
throughout the full term of this note, so that the interest rate is uniform
throughout the full term of this note. The provisions of this Paragraph shall
control all agreements, whether now or hereafter existing and whether written or
oral, between Makers and Payee.

      6. DEFAULT. If any Event of Default occurs under any Loan Document, then
that shall automatically constitute default under this note, the obligation (if
any) of Payee to make further advances against this note shall cease and
terminate and the owner or holder hereof may, at its, his or her option,
exercise any or all rights, powers and remedies afforded under any Loan Document
and by law, including the right to declare the unpaid balance of principal and
accrued interest on this note at once mature and payable.

      7. NO WAIVER BY PAYEE. No delay or omission of Payee or any other holder
hereof to exercise any power, right or remedy accruing to Payee or any other
holder hereof shall impair any such power, right or remedy or shall be construed
to be a waiver of the right to exercise any such power, right or remedy. Payee's
right to accelerate this note for any late payment or any Maker's failure to
timely fulfill its other obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
shall not be waived or deemed waived by Payee by Payee's having accepted a late
payment or late payments in the past or Payee otherwise not accelerating this
note or exercising other remedies for any Maker's failure to timely fulfill its
other obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. Payee shall not
be obligated or be deemed obligated to notify Makers that it is requiring Makers
to strictly comply with the terms and provisions of this note and the other Loan
Documents before accelerating this note and exercising its other remedies
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents because of any Maker's failure to
timely perform its obligations under this note and the other Loan Documents.

      8. COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any holder of this note retains an
attorney in connection with any default or to collect, enforce or defend this
note or any of the Loan Documents in any lawsuit or in any probate,
reorganization, bankruptcy or other proceeding, or if any Maker sues any holder
in connection with this note or any of the Loan Documents and does not prevail,
then Makers jointly and severally agree to pay to each such holder, in addition
to principal and interest, all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such
holder in trying to collect this note or in any such suit or proceeding,
including reasonable attorneys' fees. To the extent not prohibited by applicable
law or otherwise provided in the Loan Documents, Makers will pay all

                             Page 3 of 7 Pages
<PAGE>
costs and expenses and reimburse Payee for any and all reasonable expenditures
of every character incurred or expended from time to time, regardless of whether
or not a default has occurred, in connection with (a) the preparation,
negotiation, documentation, closing, renewal, revision, modification, increase,
review or restructuring of this note or any loan or credit facility evidenced by
or relating to this note, including legal, accounting, auditing, or in
connection with collecting or attempting to enforce or collect this note or any
of the other Loan Documents, (b) Payee's evaluating, monitoring, administrating
and protecting any Collateral now or hereafter securing payment of any part of
this note and (c) Payee's creating, perfecting and realizing upon Payee's
security interests in and liens on any Collateral, and all reasonable costs and
expenses relating to Payee's exercising any of its rights and remedies hereunder
or under any other Loan Document or at law, including, without limitation,
appraisal fees, consulting fees, filing fees, taxes, brokerage fees and
commissions, title review and abstract fees, Uniform Commercial Code search
fees, other fees and expenses incident to title searches, reports and security
interests, escrow fees, attorneys' fees, legal expenses, court costs, other fees
and expenses incurred in connection with any complete or partial liquidation of
any Collateral and fees and expenses for any professional services relating to
the Collateral or any operations conducted in connection with it; PROVIDED, that
no right or option granted by any Maker to Payee or otherwise arising pursuant
to any provision of this or any other instrument shall be deemed to impose or
admit a duty on Payee to supervise, monitor or control any aspect of the
character or condition of the Collateral or any operations conducted in
connection with it for the benefit of Makers or any other person or entity other
than Payee. Each Maker agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Payee, its
shareholders, directors, officers, agents and employees (collectively
"INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") harmless from and against any and all loss, liability,
obligation, damage, penalty, judgment, claim, deficiency, expense, action, suit,
cost and disbursement of any kind or nature whatsoever (including interest,
penalties, attorneys' fees and amounts paid in settlement), REGARDLESS OF
WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY OF THE INDEMNIFIED
PARTIES (BUT NOT GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), imposed on, incurred
by or asserted against the Indemnified Parties growing out of or resulting from
this note, any Loan Document or any transaction or event contemplated herein or
therein (except that such indemnity shall not be paid to any Indemnified Party
to the extent that such loss, etc. directly results from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of that Indemnified Party). Any amount to be paid under this
Paragraph by any Maker to Payee shall be a demand obligation owing by such Maker
to Payee and shall bear interest from the date of expenditure until paid at the
Past Due Rate.

      9. WAIVERS BY MAKERS AND OTHERS. Except to the extent, if any, that notice
of default is expressly required herein or in any of the other Loan Documents,
each Maker and any and all co-makers, endorsers, guarantors and sureties
severally waive notice (including, but not limited to, notice of intent to
accelerate and notice of acceleration, notice of protest and notice of
dishonor), demand, presentment for payment, protest, diligence in collecting and
the filing of suit for the purpose of fixing liability and consent that the time
of payment hereof may be extended and re-extended from time to time without
notice to any of them. Each such person agrees that his, her or its liability on
or with respect to this note shall not be affected by any release of or change
in any guaranty or security at any time existing or by any failure to perfect or
to maintain perfection of any lien against or security interest in any such
security or the partial or complete

                             Page 4 of 7 Pages
<PAGE>
unenforceability of any guaranty or other surety obligation, in each case in
whole or in part, with or without notice and before or after maturity.

      10. PARAGRAPH HEADINGS. Paragraph headings appearing in this note are for
convenient reference only and shall not be used to interpret or limit the
meaning of any provision of this note.

      11. VENUE; CHOICE OF LAW. This note is performable in Dallas County,
Texas, which shall be a proper place of venue for suit on or in respect of this
note. Each Maker hereby irrevocably agrees that any legal proceeding in respect
of this note shall be brought in the district courts of Dallas County, Texas, or
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas
Division (collectively, the "SPECIFIED COURTS"). Each Maker hereby irrevocably
submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the
State of Texas. Each Maker hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying
of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
note or any of the Loan Documents brought in any Specified Court, and hereby
further irrevocably waives any claims that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Maker
further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the
Specified Courts in any such suit, action or proceeding by the mailing of copies
thereof by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to such
Maker. Nothing herein shall affect the right of Payee to commence legal
proceedings or otherwise proceed against any Maker in any jurisdiction or to
serve process in any manner permitted by applicable law. Each Maker agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FROM
TIME TO TIME IN EFFECT.

      12. OFFSET RIGHTS. Payee is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, without notice to any person or entity (and each Maker hereby WAIVES any
such notice) to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set-off and apply any
and all monies, securities and other properties of any Maker now or in the
future in the possession, custody or control of Payee, or on deposit with or
otherwise owed to any Maker by Payee--including without limitation all such
monies, securities and other properties held in general, special, time, demand,
provisional or final accounts or for safekeeping or as collateral or otherwise
(but excluding those accounts clearly designated as escrow or trust accounts
held by any Maker for others)--against any and all of such Maker's obligations
to Payee now or hereafter existing under this note, irrespective of whether
Payee shall have made any demand under this note. Payee agrees to use reasonable
efforts to promptly notify such Maker after any such set-off and application
made by Payee, PROVIDED that failure to give--or delay in giving--any such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application or impose
any liability on Payee. Payee's rights under this Paragraph are in addition to
other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
set-off) which Payee may have.

      13. SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. This note and all the covenants and agreements
contained herein shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the
respective legal representatives, heirs, successors and assigns of Makers and
Payee.

      14. RECORDS OF PAYMENTS. The records of Payee shall be, absent manifest
error, prima facie evidence of the amounts owing on this note.

      15. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this note is held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws, the legality, validity
and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this note shall not be
affected thereby, and this note shall be liberally construed so as to carry out
the intent of the parties to it. Each waiver in this note is subject to the
overriding and controlling rule that it shall be effective only if and to the
extent that (a) it is not prohibited by applicable law and (b) applicable law
neither provides for nor allows any material sanctions to be imposed against
Payee for having bargained for and obtained it.

      16. SALE AND ASSIGNMENT. Payee shall have the absolute and unrestricted
right to sell, assign, transfer, or grant participation in, all or any portion
of the loans and any collateral, guaranties or other security relating thereto
without the consent of any Maker; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, no such action on the part
of Payee shall have the effect of changing such Maker's obligations hereunder
without the written consent of Maker. Payee shall give Makers written notice of
any absolute assignment of any of the loans if the result thereof will be to
cause any Maker to deal directly with another financial institution which is not
the successor in interest by merger to Payee.

      17. NOTICES. Any notice, request or other communication required or

<PAGE>

      (e) "STATED RATE" means, on any day, the rate per annum as provided in

      2. LOAN AGREEMENT; ADVANCES; SECURITY. This note has been issued pursuant
to the terms of the Loan Agreement, and is the Term Note referred to in the Loan
Agreement. Advances against this note by Payee or other holder hereof shall be
governed by the terms and provisions of the Loan Agreement. Reference is hereby
made to the Loan Agreement for all purposes. Payee is entitled to the benefits
of and security provided for in the Loan Agreement. The unpaid principal balance
of this note at any time shall be the total of all amounts lent or advanced
against this note less the amount of all payments or permitted prepayments made
on this note and by or for the account of Makers. All loans and advances and all
payments and permitted prepayments made hereon may be endorsed by the holder of
this note on a schedule which may be attached hereto (and thereby made a part
hereof for all purposes) or otherwise recorded in the holder's records;
PROVIDED, that any failure to make notation of (a) any advance shall not cancel,
limit or otherwise affect any Maker's obligations or any holder's rights with
respect to that advance, or (b) any payment or permitted prepayment of principal
shall not cancel, limit or otherwise affect any Maker's entitlement to credit
for that payment as of the date received by the holder.

      3. COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. Interest on the amount of each advance against

is made.

      4. MANDATORY PAYMENTS OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST. The principal of this

note shall be due and payable as provided in Section 2.5.2 of the Loan
Agreement. In addition, all principal of this note, together with accrued and

      5. NO USURY INTENDED; SPREADING. Reference is hereby made to Section 2.6
of the Loan Agreement, which is incorporated herein and hereby made a part
hereof. Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary contained in this note or
any of the other Loan Documents, it is expressly provided that in no case or
event shall the aggregate of (i) all interest on the unpaid balance of this
note, accrued or paid from the date hereof and (ii) the aggregate of any other
amounts accrued or paid pursuant to this note or any of the other Loan
Documents, which under applicable laws are or may be deemed to constitute
interest upon the indebtedness evidenced by this note from the date hereof, ever
exceed the Maximum Legal Rate. In this connection, Makers and Payee stipulate
and agree that it is their common and overriding intent to contract in strict

                             Page 2 of 7 Pages
<PAGE>
compliance with applicable usury laws. In furtherance thereof, none of the terms
of this note or any of the other Loan Documents shall ever be construed to
create a contract to pay, as consider ation for the use, forbearance or
detention of money, interest at a rate in excess of the Maximum Legal Rate. Any
Maker or other parties now or hereafter becoming liable for payment of the
indebtedness evidenced by this note shall never be liable for interest in excess
of the Maximum Legal Rate. If, for any reason whatever, the interest paid or
received on this note during its full term produces a rate which exceeds the
Maximum Legal Rate, the holder of this note shall credit against the principal
of this note (or, if such indebtedness shall have been paid in full, shall
refund to the payor of such interest) such portion of said interest as shall be
necessary to cause the interest paid on this note to produce a rate equal to the
Maximum Legal Rate. All sums paid or agreed to be paid to the holder of this
note for the use, forbearance or detention of the indebtedness evidenced hereby
shall, to the extent permitted by applicable law, be amortized, prorated,
allocated and spread in equal parts throughout the full term of this note, so
that the interest rate is uniform throughout the full term of this note. The
provisions of this Paragraph shall control all agreements, whether now or
hereafter existing and whether written or oral, between Makers and Payee.

      6. DEFAULT. If any Event of Default occurs under the Loan Agreement, then
that shall automatically constitute default under this note, the obligation (if
any) of Payee to make further advances against this note shall cease and
terminate and the owner or holder hereof may, at its, his or her option,
exercise any or all rights, powers and remedies afforded under any Loan Document
and by law, including the right to declare the unpaid balance of principal and
accrued interest on this note at once mature and payable.

      7. NO WAIVER BY PAYEE. No delay or omission of Payee or any other holder
hereof to exercise any power, right or remedy accruing to Payee or any other
holder hereof shall impair any such power, right or remedy or shall be construed
to be a waiver of the right to exercise any such power, right or remedy. Payee's
right to accelerate this note for any late payment or any Maker's failure to
timely fulfill its other obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents
shall not be waived or deemed waived by Payee by Payee's having accepted a late
payment or late payments in the past or Payee otherwise not accelerating this
note or exercising other remedies for any Maker's failure to timely fulfill its
other obligations hereunder or under the other Loan Documents. Payee shall not
be obligated or be deemed obligated to notify Makers that it is requiring Makers
to strictly comply with the terms and provisions of this note and the other Loan
Documents before accelerating this note and exercising its other remedies
hereunder or under the other Loan Documents because of any Maker's failure to
timely perform its obligations under this note and the other Loan Documents.

      8. COSTS AND ATTORNEYS' FEES. If any holder of this note retains an
attorney in connection with any default or to collect, enforce or defend this
note or any of the Loan Documents in any lawsuit or in any probate,
reorganization, bankruptcy or other proceeding, or if any Maker sues any holder
in connection with this note or any of the Loan Documents and does not prevail,
then Makers jointly and severally agree to pay to each such holder, in addition
to principal and interest, all reasonable costs and expenses incurred by such
holder in trying to collect

                             Page 3 of 7 Pages
<PAGE>
this note or in any such suit or proceeding, including reasonable attorneys'
fees. To the extent not prohibited by applicable law or otherwise provided in
the Loan Documents, Makers will pay all costs and expenses and reimburse Payee
for any and all reasonable expenditures of every character incurred or expended
from time to time, regardless of whether or not a default has occurred, in
connection with (a) the preparation, negotiation, documentation, closing,
renewal, revision, modification, increase, review or restructuring of this note
or any loan or credit facility evidenced by or relating to this note, including
legal, accounting, auditing, or in connection with collecting or attempting to
enforce or collect this note or any of the other Loan Documents, (b) Payee's
evaluating, monitoring, administrating and protecting any Collateral now or
hereafter securing payment of any part of this note and (c) Payee's creating,
perfecting and realizing upon Payee's security interests in and liens on any
Collateral, and all reasonable costs and expenses relating to Payee's exercising
any of its rights and remedies hereunder or under any other Loan Document or at
law, including, without limitation, appraisal fees, consulting fees, filing
fees, taxes, brokerage fees and commissions, title review and abstract fees,
Uniform Commercial Code search fees, other fees and expenses incident to title
searches, reports and security interests, escrow fees, attorneys' fees, legal
expenses, court costs, other fees and expenses incurred in connection with any
complete or partial liquidation of any Collateral and fees and expenses for any
professional services relating to the Collateral or any operations conducted in
connection with it; PROVIDED, that no right or option granted by any Maker to
Payee or otherwise arising pursuant to any provision of this or any other
instrument shall be deemed to impose or admit a duty on Payee to supervise,
monitor or control any aspect of the character or condition of the Collateral or
any operations conducted in connection with it for the benefit of Makers or any
other person or entity other than Payee. Each Maker agrees to indemnify, defend
and hold Payee, its shareholders, directors, officers, agents and employees
(collectively "INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") harmless from and against any and all loss,
liability, obligation, damage, penalty, judgment, claim, deficiency, expense,
action, suit, cost and disbursement of any kind or nature whatsoever (including
interest, penalties, attorneys' fees and amounts paid in settlement), REGARDLESS
OF WHETHER CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF ANY OF THE
INDEMNIFIED PARTIES (BUT NOT GROSS NEGLIGENCE OR WILLFUL MISCONDUCT), imposed
on, incurred by or asserted against the Indemnified Parties growing out of or
resulting from this note, any Loan Document or any transaction or event
contemplated herein or therein (except that such indemnity shall not be paid to
any Indemnified Party to the extent that such loss, etc. directly results from
the gross negligence or willful misconduct of that Indemnified Party). Any
amount to be paid under this Paragraph by any Maker to Payee shall be a demand
obligation owing by such Maker to Payee and shall bear interest from the date of
expenditure until paid at the Past Due Rate.

      9. WAIVERS BY MAKERS AND OTHERS. Except to the extent, if any, that notice
of default is expressly required herein or in any of the other Loan Documents,
each Maker and any and all co-makers, endorsers, guarantors and sureties
severally waive notice (including, but not limited to, notice of intent to
accelerate and notice of acceleration, notice of protest and notice of
dishonor), demand, presentment for payment, protest, diligence in collecting and
the filing of suit for the purpose of fixing liability and consent that the time
of payment hereof may be extended and re-extended from time to time without
notice to any of them. Each such person agrees that his,

                             Page 4 of 7 Pages
<PAGE>
her or its liability on or with respect to this note shall not be affected by
any release of or change in any guaranty or security at any time existing or by
any failure to perfect or to maintain perfection of any lien against or security
interest in any such security or the partial or complete unenforceability of any
guaranty or other surety obligation, in each case in whole or in part, with or
without notice and before or after maturity.

      10. PARAGRAPH HEADINGS. Paragraph headings appearing in this note are for
convenient reference only and shall not be used to interpret or limit the
meaning of any provision of this note.

      11. VENUE; CHOICE OF LAW. This note is performable in Dallas County,
Texas, which shall be a proper place of venue for suit on or in respect of this
note. Each Maker hereby irrevocably agrees that any legal proceeding in respect
of this note shall be brought in the district courts of Dallas County, Texas, or
in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Texas, Dallas
Division (collectively, the "SPECIFIED COURTS"). Each Maker hereby irrevocably
submits to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of the
State of Texas. Each Maker hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent
permitted by law, any objection which it may now or hereafter have to the laying
of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
note or any of the Loan Documents brought in any Specified Court, and hereby
further irrevocably waives any claims that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in any such court has been brought in an inconvenient forum. Each Maker
further irrevocably consents to the service of process out of any of the
Specified Courts in any such suit, action or proceeding by the mailing of copies
thereof by certified mail, return receipt requested, postage prepaid, to such
Maker. Nothing herein shall affect the right of Payee to commence legal
proceedings or otherwise proceed against any Maker in any jurisdiction or to
serve process in any manner permitted by applicable law. Each Maker agrees that
a final judgment in any such action or proceeding shall be conclusive and may be
enforced in other jurisdictions by suit on the judgment or in any other manner
provided by law. THIS NOTE SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH
THE APPLICABLE LAWS OF THE STATE OF TEXAS AND THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA FROM
TIME TO TIME IN EFFECT.

      12. OFFSET RIGHTS. Payee is hereby authorized at any time and from time to
time, without notice to any person or entity (and each Maker hereby WAIVES any
such notice) to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set-off and apply any
and all monies, securities and other properties of any Maker now or in the
future in the possession, custody or control of Payee, or on deposit with or
otherwise owed to any Maker by Payee--including without limitation all such
monies, securities and other properties held in general, special, time, demand,
provisional or final accounts or for safekeeping or as collateral or otherwise
(but excluding those accounts clearly designated as escrow or trust accounts
held by any Maker for others)--against any and all of such Maker's obligations
to Payee now or hereafter existing under this note, irrespective of whether
Payee shall have made any demand under this note. Payee agrees to use reasonable
efforts to promptly notify such Maker after any such set-off and application
made by Payee, PROVIDED that failure to give--or delay in giving--any such
notice shall not affect the validity of such set-off and application or impose
any liability on Payee. Payee's rights under this Paragraph are in addition

                             Page 5 of 7 Pages
<PAGE>
to other rights and remedies (including, without limitation, other rights of
set-off) which Payee may have.

contained herein shall be binding upon, and shall inure to the benefit of, the

Payee.

error, prima facie evidence of the amounts owing on this note.

      15. SEVERABILITY. If any provision of this note is held to be illegal,
invalid or unenforceable under present or future laws, the legality, validity
and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this note shall not be
affected thereby, and this note shall be liberally construed so as to carry out
the intent of the parties to it. Each waiver in this note is subject to the
overriding and controlling rule that it shall be effective only if and to the
extent that (a) it is not prohibited by applicable law and (b) applicable law
neither provides for nor allows any material sanctions to be imposed against
Payee for having bargained for and obtained it.

      16. SALE AND ASSIGNMENT. Payee shall have the absolute and unrestricted
right to sell, assign, transfer, or grant participation in, all or any portion
of the loans and any collateral, guaranties or other security relating thereto
without the consent of any Maker; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, no such action on the part
of Payee shall have the effect of changing such Maker's obligations hereunder
without the written consent of Maker. Payee shall give Makers written notice of
any absolute assignment of any of the loans if the result thereof will be to
cause any Maker to deal directly with another financial institution which is not
the successor in interest by merger to Payee.

      17. NOTICES. Any notice, request or other communication required or
permitted to be given hereunder shall be made as provided in the Loan Agreement.

      18. PREPAYMENT. Makers may at any time pay the full amount or any part of

lawful owner of such Collateral and has the right and authority to subject the
same to a security interest in Bank; (ii) none of the Collateral is subject to
any security interest other than that in favor of Bank, and there are no
financing statements on file other than Permitted Liens; and (iii) Debtor
acquired its rights in the Collateral in the ordinary course of its business.

      (g) On each occasion on which Debtor evidences to Bank the account

enforceable without performance by Debtor of any other act; (ii) the account
balances so evidenced are in fact owing; and (iii) there are no setoffs,
counterclaims or defenses against any such Account Receivable.

business. Bank or its agents or attorneys may at any and all reasonable times
inspect the Collateral and may enter upon any and all premises where the same is

      (i) Debtor will do all acts and things, and will execute all writings
reasonably requested by Bank to establish, maintain and continue the perfected
and first security interest of Bank in the Collateral, and will promptly on
demand pay all costs and expenses of filing and recording, including the costs
of any searches deemed necessary by Bank to establish and determine the validity
and the priority of Bank's security interest. With respect to any vehicle
constituting a part of the Collateral, Debtor will take all steps necessary to
effect upon the certificate of title to any such vehicle an indication of the
security interest of Bank therein. As of the date hereof, all Collateral subject
to certificate of title laws is described on EXHIBIT C attached hereto and
incorporated herein by reference for all purposes.

      (j) Debtor will pay promptly and in the time that they can be paid without
interest or penalty all taxes, assessments and similar posts and charges which
are now, or hereafter during the effective period of this Agreement may become,
a lien, charge or encumbrance upon any of the Collateral except to the extent
contested in good faith and bonded in a manner satisfactory to

                                    -4-
<PAGE>
Bank. If Debtor fails to pay any such taxes, assessments or other charges as
they become due, Bank shall have the option to do so and Debtor agrees to repay
all amounts so expended by Bank immediately upon demand, together with interest
at the Past Due Rate.

      (k) Debtor will keep the Collateral in good condition and shall safeguard
and protect the same from loss, damage or deterioration from any cause
whatsoever. Debtor has and will maintain at all times during the effective
period of this Agreement with respect to the Collateral, insurance against fire

business to that of Debtor, in such amounts, containing such terms, in such
form, for such purposes and written by such companies as may be reasonably
satisfactory to Bank, naming Bank as "loss/payee," and Debtor will deliver to
Bank evidence satisfactory to Bank that such insurance has been so procured. If
Debtor fails to maintain satisfactory insurance, Bank shall have the option to
do so and Debtor agrees to repay all amounts so expended by Bank immediately
upon demand, together with interest at the Past Due Rate.

PARAGRAPH 2(D) of this Agreement, Debtor shall make or permit no modification,
compromise or substitution for such contract except in the normal course of
Debtor's business without the prior consent of Bank; PROVIDED that in no event
shall Debtor take any action or a series of related actions which would or could
materially adversely affect the value of the Collateral.

      (m) Debtor will reimburse Bank for all expenses, including, without
limitation, reasonable attorney fees and legal expenses, incurred by Bank in
seeking to collect the Indebtedness or any part thereof, in defending the
priority of Bank's security interest or in pursuing any of its rights or
remedies hereunder.

      (n) The Pledged Documents are in full force and effect and there is no
agreement amending, modifying or rearranging the Pledged Documents or
diminishing or impairing the liability of any person or entity primarily or
secondarily obligated to make payment in respect of any of the Collateral (each
a "COLLATERAL OBLIGOR") to perform fully its obligations in strict accordance
with the writings creating or evidencing the obligation of such Collateral

surety for or of any of the Pledged Documents to perform fully its obligations

      (o) Debtor has heretofore obtained the written consent of all necessary
parties, if any, required to be obtained under the Pledged Documents or
otherwise to authorize the assignment, transfer, pledge of and the grant of the
security interest in the Collateral evidenced by this Agree ment (promptly upon
request by Bank, Debtor agrees to furnish to Bank copies of all executed
original written consents, if any, as shall be required by Bank in connection
with or arising out of the security interest granted hereby).

      (p) The Pledged Documents are the valid and legally binding obligations of
the parties thereto, enforceable in accordance with their terms.

      (q) True, correct and complete copies of the Pledged Documents have
heretofore been delivered to Bank.

      (r) No default or event of default on the part of Debtor or on the part of

      (s) Debtor will (i) perform or cause to be performed all of the terms,
covenants and conditions on its part to be performed under the Pledged
Documents; (ii) promptly notify Bank in writing of (x) the occurrence of any
default in the observance or performance of any of the terms, covenants or
conditions of the Pledged Documents; (y) the giving of any notice of any such
default, and (z) the receipt of any written notice with respect to the Pledged
Documents; and (iii) whenever reasonably required by Bank, at the sole cost and
expense of Debtor, take all such action as may be so requested to enforce or
secure the performance of any term, covenant or condition of the Pledged
Documents and to exercise any right of Debtor under the Pledged Documents.

      (t) Without the prior written consent of Bank, Debtor will not (i) reduce

consent to any of the foregoing.

      (u) It is expressly agreed that, anything herein contained to the contrary
notwithstanding, Debtor shall remain liable under the Pledged Documents to
perform all of its obligations thereunder, and Bank shall have no obligation or
liability under the Pledged Documents by reason of or arising out of this
Agreement, nor shall Bank be required or obligated by reason of this Agreement
in any manner to perform or fulfill any obligation of Debtor under or pursuant
to the Pledged Documents, or to make any payment, or to make any inquiry as to
the nature or sufficiency of any payment received by it pursuant to or in
connection with this Agreement.

3.    COLLECTION OF PROCEEDS.

      (a) Subject in any event to the last sentence of this PARAGRAPH 3(A),
Debtor agrees to hold in trust for Bank all payments received on Accounts
Receivable and from the sale of any Inventory, all rights by way of suretyship
or guaranty which Debtor now has or may hereafter acquire to enforce payment of
Accounts Receivable, and all rights in the nature of a mortgage, lien or
security interest whereby Debtor may satisfy any Account Receivable out of
property. Debtor agrees to collect and enforce payment of all Accounts
Receivable until Bank shall direct Debtor to the contrary and, from and after
such direction, Debtor agrees to fully and promptly cooperate and assist Bank
(or any other person as Bank shall designate) in the collection and enforcement
of all Accounts Receivable. Immediately upon notice to such effect to Debtor by
Bank and at all

                                    -6-
<PAGE>
times thereafter, Debtor agrees to (i) endorse to Bank and forthwith deliver to
Bank all payments received by Debtor on Accounts Receivable or from the sale of
any Inventory or arising from any other rights or interests of Debtor therein,
in the form received by Debtor without commingling with any funds belonging to

or hereafter coming into Debtor's possession through enforcement of any such
rights or interests.

      (b) Debtor authorizes Bank or any employee or agent thereof to endorse the
name of Debtor upon any checks or other items which are received in payment of
any Account Receivable or for any Inventory, and to do any and all things
necessary in order to reduce the same to cash.

      (c) Bank shall have no duty as to the collection or protection of
Collateral or the proceeds thereof, nor as to the preservation of any rights
pertaining thereto, beyond the use of reasonable care in the custody and
preservation of Collateral in the possession of Bank. Debtor agrees to take all
steps necessary to preserve rights against prior parties with respect to
Debtor's Property in the Possession of Bank.

      (a) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default (herein so called), Debtor
shall be in default under this Agreement.

      (b) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default, Bank may at its
discretion and without prior notice to Debtor declare any or all of the
Indebtedness to be immediately due and payable, and shall have and may exercise
any one or more of the following rights and remedies:

            (i) exercise all the rights and remedies upon default, in
foreclosure and otherwise, available to secured parties under the provisions of
the Uniform Commercial Code and other applicable law;

            (ii) institute legal proceedings to foreclose upon and against the
lien and security interest granted by this Agreement, to recover judgment for
all amounts then due and owing as Indebtedness secured hereby and to collect the
same out of any of the Collateral or the proceeds of any sale thereof;

            (iii) institute legal proceedings for the sale, under the judgment
or decree of any court of competent jurisdiction, of any or all of the
Collateral;

            (iv) personally or by agents or attorneys, enter upon any premises
where the Collateral or any part thereof may then be located, and take

damage caused by the willful misconduct or gross negligence of Bank or any agent
or attorney thereof),

                                    -7-
<PAGE>
                  (A) hold, store, and keep idle, or lease, operate, remove or
      otherwise use or permit the use of the Collateral or any part thereof, for
      such time and upon such terms as Bank may in its sole and complete
      discretion deem to be in its own best interest, and demand, collect and
      retain all hire, earnings and other sums due and to become due in respect
      of the same from any party whomsoever, accounting only for net earnings,
      if any (unless the Collateral is retained in satisfaction of the
      Indebtedness, in which case no accounting will be necessary), arising from
      such use (which net earnings shall be applied against the Indebtedness and
      charged against all receipts from the use of the same or from the sale
      thereof, by court proceedings or pursuant to SUBPARAGRAPH (B) below, all
      other costs, expenses, charges, damages and other losses resulting from
      such use).

                  (B) sell, lease, dispose of, or cause to be sold, leased or
      disposed of, all or any part of the Collateral at one or more public or
      private sales, leasings or other dispositions, at such places and times

      previous demand or advertisement but with reasonable notification to
      Debtor of any such sale, lease or other disposal; and except as herein
      provided, all notice of sale, lease or other disposition, and
      advertisement, and other notice or demand, any right or equity of
      redemption, and any obligation of a prospective purchaser or lessee to
      inquire as to the power and authority of Bank to sell, lease or otherwise
      dispose of the Collateral or as to the application by Bank of the proceeds
      of sale or otherwise, which would otherwise be required by, or available
      to Debtor under, applicable law are hereby expressly waived by Debtor to
      the fullest extent permitted by such law.

At any sale pursuant to this PARAGRAPH 4(B), whether under the power of sale or
by virtue of judicial proceedings, it shall not be necessary for Bank or a
public officer under order of a court to have present physical or constructive
possession of the Collateral to be sold. The recitals contained in any
conveyances and receipts made and given by Bank or such public officer to any
purchaser at any sale made pursuant to this Agreement shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, conclusively, establish the truth and accuracy of
the matters therein stated (including, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the amounts of the principal of and interest on the Indebtedness, the
accrual and nonpayment thereof and advertisement and conduct of such sale in the
manner provided herein and by applicable law); and all prerequisites to such
sale shall be presumed to have been satisfied and performed. Upon any sale
hereunder of any of the Collateral or any interest therein, the receipt of the
officer making such sale under judicial proceedings or of Bank shall be
sufficient discharge to the purchaser for the purchase money, and such purchaser
shall not be obligated to see the application thereof. Any sale hereunder of any
of the Collateral or any interest therein shall forever be a perpetual bar
against Debtor with respect to such Collateral.

            (v) In addition, the Bank may foreclose this Agreement by executory
process subject to, and on the terms and conditions required or permitted by,
applicable law, and shall have the right to appoint a keeper of the Collateral.
Debtor acknowledges the Indebtedness, whether now existing or to arise
hereafter, and for Debtor, Debtor's heirs, devisees, personal representatives,
successors and assigns, hereby confesses judgment for the full amount of the

                                    -8-
<PAGE>
Indebtedness, in favor of the Bank. Debtor further agrees that the Bank may
cause all or any part of the Collateral to be seized and sold after due process
of law, the Debtor waiving the benefit of all laws or parts of laws relative to
the appraisement of properties seized and sold under executory process or other
legal process, and consenting that all or any part of the Collateral may be sold
without appraisement, either in its entirety or in lots and parcels, as the Bank
may determine, to the highest bidder for cash or on such terms as the plaintiff
in such proceedings may direct. Debtor hereby waives (i) the benefit of
appraisement provided for in articles 2332, 2336, 2723, and 2724 of the
Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure and all other laws conferring the same; (ii)
the demand and three (3) days' notice of demand as provided in articles 2639 and
2721 of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure; (iii) the notice of seizure
provided for in articles 2293 and 2721 of the Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure;
(iv) the three (3) days delay provided for in articles 2331 and 2722 of the
Louisiana Code of Civil Procedure; and (v) all other laws providing rights of
notice, demand, appraisement, or delay. Debtor expressly authorizes and agrees
that the Bank shall have the right to appoint a keeper of the Collateral
pursuant to the terms and provisions of La. R.S. 9:5131 ET SEQ. and La. R.S.
9:5136 ET SEQ., which keeper may be the Bank, any agent or employee thereof, or
any other person, firm, or corporation. Compensation for the services of the
keeper is hereby fixed at five percent (5%) of the amount due or sued for or
claimed or sought to be protected, preserved, or enforced in the proceeding for
the recognition or enforcement of this Agreement and shall be secured by the
liens and security interests of this Agreement.

      (c) Upon the occurrence of any Event of Default and so long as it is
continuing, Debtor shall at any time at the request of Bank, notify the account
debtors or obligors of the security interest of Bank in any Accounts Receivable
and direct payment thereof to Bank. Bank may, itself, upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default, so notify and direct any such account debtor or obligor and
may take control of any proceeds to which it may be entitled hereunder.

      (d) The proceeds of any sale or other disposition of Collateral authorized
by this Agreement or the Loan Agreement shall be applied by Bank first upon all
expenses authorized by the Uniform Commercial Code and all reasonable attorney
fees and legal expenses incurred by Bank; the balance of the proceeds of such
sale or other disposition shall be applied in the payment of the Indebtedness,
first to interest, then to principal; and the surplus, if any, shall be paid
over to Debtor or to such other person or persons as may be entitled thereto
under applicable law. Debtor shall remain liable for any deficiency which it
shall pay to Bank immediately upon demand.

      (e) Nothing herein contained is intended, nor should it be construed, to
preclude Bank from pursuing any other remedy provided by law for the collection
of the Indebtedness or any portion thereof, or for the recovery of any other sum
to which Bank may be or become entitled for the breach of this Agreement by
Debtor, nor shall anything contained herein reduce in any way any rights of Bank
contained in any existing agreement between Debtor and Bank.

      (f) No waiver of default shall be effective unless in writing signed by an
officer of Bank, and no waiver of any default or forbearance on the part of Bank
in enforcing any of its

                                    -9-
<PAGE>
rights under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver of any other default or of
the same default on a future occasion or of any such right.

      (g) Debtor hereby irrevocably appoints Bank (which appointment is coupled
with an interest) the true and lawful attorney of Debtor (with full power of
substitution) in the name, place and stead of, and at the expense of, Debtor:

            (i) to demand, receive, sue for and give receipts or acquittances
      for any moneys due or to become due on any Account Receivable;

            (ii) with respect to any Collateral, to assent to any or all
      extensions or postponements of the time of payment thereof or any other
      indulgence in connection therewith, to the substitution, exchange or
      release of Collateral, to the addition or release of any party primarily
      or secondarily liable, to the acceptance of partial payments thereon and
      the settlement, compromise or adjustment thereof, all in such manner and
      at such time or times as Bank shall deem advisable;

            (iii) to make all necessary transfers of all or any part of the
      Collateral in connection with any sale, lease or other disposition made
      pursuant hereto;

            (iv) to execute and deliver for value all necessary or appropriate
      bills of sale, assignments and other instruments in connection with any
      such sale, lease or other disposition, Debtor hereby ratifying and
      confirming all that it said attorney (or any substitute) shall lawfully do
      hereunder and pursuant hereto. Nevertheless, if so requested by Bank or a
      purchaser or lessee, Debtor shall ratify and confirm any sale, lease or
      other disposition by executing and delivering to Bank or such purchaser or
      lessee all proper bills or sale, assignments, releases, leases and other
      instruments as may be designated in any such request;

            (v) upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, to establish a
      United States Post Office Box in the name of Debtor but under the
      exclusive custody and control of Bank; to direct all parties obligated on
      any Account Receivable to make all payments due and to become due thereon
      to the United States Post Office Box established by Bank in the name of
      Debtor or to make said payments directly to Bank; to direct the Postmaster
      of the United States Post Office to forward to the Bank all mail addressed
      to the Debtor or to hold all mail addressed to Debtor at the Post Office
      until an officer or employee of the Bank shall request possession of same;
      to open and dispose of all mail, howsoever received by Bank, addressed to
      Debtor; and to endorse any item, howsoever received by Bank, representing
      any payment on or other proceeds or products of the Collateral; and

            (vi) to execute and file in the name of and on behalf of Debtor all
      financing statements or other filings deemed necessary or desirable by
      Bank to evidence or perfect the security interests herein granted.

conform strictly to the applicable laws of the State of Delaware and the United

determinations thereof regarding the contracting for, charging and receiving of
interest for the use, forbearance, and detention of money (referred to as
"Applicable Law"). The Holder shall have no right to claim, to charge or to
receive any interest in excess of the maximum rate of interest, if any,
permitted to be charged on that portion of the amount representing principal
which is outstanding and unpaid from time to time by Applicable Law.
Determination of the rate of interest for the purpose of determining whether
this Note is usurious under Applicable Law shall be made by amortizing,
prorating, allocating and spreading in equal parts during the period of the
actual time of this Note, all interest or other sums deemed to be interest
(referred to in this Section as "Interest") at any time contracted for, charged
or received

shall be deemed a result of a mathematical error and a mistake. If this Note is
paid in part prior to the end of the full stated term of this Note and the
Interest received for the actual period of existence of this Note exceeds the
maximum rate allowed by Applicable Law, Holder shall credit the amount of the
excess against any amount owing under this Note or, if this Note has been paid
in full, or in the event that it has been accelerated prior to maturity, Holder
shall refund to the Company the amount of such excess, and shall not be subject
to any of the penalties provided by Applicable Law for contracting for, charging
or receiving Interest in excess of the maximum rate allowed by Applicable Law.
Any such excess which is unpaid shall be canceled.

                                        2
<PAGE>

        Seller represents and warrants to Purchasers as follows:

        2.1 ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND QUALIFICATION. Seller is a corporation
duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Delaware and has all requisite corporate power and authority to own,
lease and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Seller is licensed and qualified to do business as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction in which the character of Seller's properties,
owned or leased, or the nature of its activities makes such qualification or
license necessary, except where failure to be so licensed and qualified would
not have a material adverse effect on Seller's business.

        2.2 AUTHORITY; NO DEFAULTS. Seller has all requisite corporate power and
authority to enter into the Transaction Documents and to consummate the
transactions contemplated thereby. The execution and delivery of the Transaction
Documents and the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby have
been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of Seller.
The Transaction Documents have been executed and delivered by Seller and
constitute the valid and binding obligation of Seller, enforceable in accordance
with their terms, subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other
similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and general principles of
equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in a proceeding
in equity or at law). The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents do
not, and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby
will not, conflict with or result in a breach of or the acceleration of any
obligation under, or constitute a default or event of default (or event which,
with notice or lapse of time or both, would constitute a default) under, any
provision of any charter, bylaw, indenture, mortgage, lien, lease, agreement,
contract, instrument, order, judgment, decree, ordinance or regulation, or any
restriction to which any property of Seller is subject or by which Seller is
bound, the effect of which would be materially adverse to Seller. Seller is not,
nor is it alleged to be, in material violation or default of any applicable law,
statute, order, rule or regulation promulgated or judgment entered by any court,
administrative agency or commission or other governmental agency or
instrumentality, domestic or foreign (a "Governmental Entity"), relating to or
affecting the operation, conduct or ownership of the property or business of
Seller.

        2.3 APPROVALS. There is no legal impediment to the execution and
delivery of the Transaction Documents by Seller or to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and no filing or registration with, or
authorization, consent or approval of, a Governmental Entity, stockholders or
any other third party is necessary for the consummation by Seller of the
transactions contemplated thereby.

                                        3
<PAGE>

        2.4 LITIGATION. There is no suit, action, proceeding or investigation
pending or, to the best knowledge of Seller, threatened against or affecting
Seller or its properties, assets, operations or business, nor is there any
outstanding judgment, order, writ, injunction or decree against Seller. There is
no suit, action, proceeding or investigation pending, or to the best knowledge
of the Seller, threatened against or affecting Seller or its properties, assets,
operations or business which might delay or prevent the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby.

        2.5 CAPITALIZATION. Seller has authorized capital stock of (a) 100,000
shares of Common Stock of which prior to the issuance of any Securities pursuant
to this Agreement, there are 1,000 shares issued and outstanding (500 shares are
owned beneficially and of record by Randolph W. Herring and 500 shares are owned
beneficially and of record by Kevin J. Millin), and (b) 10,000 shares of
preferred stock, par value $.01 per share ("Preferred Stock"), of which none are
issued and outstanding. All of the issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock
were duly and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable. None of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock have been issued in violation of any
preemptive rights of the current or past stockholders of Seller. Except for
additional shares of Common Stock (or securities convertible into Common Stock)
currently contemplated to be issued to Herring and Millin pursuant to terms
agreeable to the parties hereto, there are no outstanding options, warrants or
rights to subscribe for, or commitments of any character whatsoever relating to,
or securities or rights convertible into or exchangeable for, shares of the
capital stock of Seller or contracts, commitments, understandings or
arrangements by which Seller is or may be obligated to issue additional shares
of its capital stock or options, warrants, or rights to purchase or acquire any
additional shares of its capital stock. All of the St. James Shares, the Herring
Shares and the Millin Shares, upon receipt of the consideration therefor as set
forth herein, will be fully paid, non-assessable and free and clear of any
preemptive rights and Encumbrances. As used in this Agreement, the term
"Encumbrance" means and includes (i) any security interest, mortgage, deed of
trust, lien, charge, pledge, proxy, adverse claim, equity, power of attorney, or
restriction of any kind, including but not limited to, any restriction or
servitude on the use, transfer, receipt of income, or other exercise of any
attributes of ownership, and (ii) any Uniform Commercial Code financing
statement or other public filing, notice or record that by its terms purports to
evidence or notify interested parties of any of the matters referred to in
clause (i) that has not been terminated or released by another proper public
filing, notice or record.

        2.6    SUBSIDIARIES.  Seller has no subsidiaries.

        2.7    LIABILITIES.  Seller was incorporated on November 14,

                                        4

favor of St. James, (ii) contemplated by the Catalyst Purchase Agreement, and
(iii) contemplated by this Agreement, Seller has no liabilities or obligations,
either accrued, absolute, contingent or otherwise.

        2.8 LICENSES, PERMITS, AUTHORIZATIONS, ETC. Seller holds all approvals,
authorizations, consents, licenses, orders, franchises, rights, registrations
and permits of any type required to operate its business as presently conducted.
The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not result in any revocation,
cancellation, suspension or modification of any such approval, authorization,
consent, license, order, franchise, right, registration or permit.

        2.9 BROKERAGE ARRANGEMENTS. Other than in connection with the Catalyst
Purchase Agreement and as payable to The GulfStar Group, Inc., Seller has not
entered (directly or indirectly) into any agreement with any person, firm or
corporation that would obligate Purchasers to pay any commission, brokerage or
"finder's fee" or any fee whatsoever in connection with the transactions
contemplated herein.

        2.10 USE OF PROCEEDS. Seller shall use the consideration for purposes of

                   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF PURCHASER

        Purchasers represent and warrant to Seller, severally and not jointly,
as follows (except for Section 3.1 to which St. James is the sole Purchaser that
so represents and warrants) to the Seller as follows:

        3.1 ORGANIZATION, STANDING AND QUALIFICATION. Purchaser is a limited
partnership duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws
of the State of Delaware and has all requisite power and authority to own, lease
and operate its properties and to carry on its business as it is now being
conducted. Purchaser is licensed and qualified to do business as a foreign
limited partnership in each jurisdiction in which the character of the

where the failure to be so licensed and qualified would not have a material
adverse effect on Purchaser's business. Purchaser is not an "investment
company," "holding company" or an affiliate of a "holding company" or a
"subsidiary company" within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended. Purchaser is not a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a
"holding company" or of a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company," as such
terms are used in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1934, as amended.

authority to enter into this Agreement and to consummate the transactions
contemplated thereby. The execution and delivery of this Agreement and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly authorized
by all necessary action on the part of Purchaser. This Agreement has been
executed and delivered by Purchaser and constitutes the valid and binding
obligation of Purchaser, enforceable in accordance with its terms, subject to
bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium and other similar laws affecting creditors'
rights generally and general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). The execution
and delivery of this Agreement does not, and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby will not, conflict with or result in a breach
of or the acceleration of any obligation under, or constitute a default or event
of default (or event which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a default) under any provision of any charter, bylaw, indenture,
mortgage, lien, lease, agreement, contract, instrument, order, judgment, decree,
ordinance or regulation, or any restriction to which any property of Purchaser
is subject or by which Purchaser is bound, the effect of which would be
materially adverse to Purchaser. Purchaser is not, nor does Purchaser have
knowledge that it is alleged to be, in material violation of default of any
applicable law, statute, order, rule or regulation promulgated or judgment
entered by any Governmental Entity, relating to or affecting the operation,
conduct or ownership of the property or business of Purchaser.

        3.3 APPROVALS. There is no legal impediment to the execution and
delivery of this Agreement by Purchaser or to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and no filing or registration with, or
authorization, consent or approval of, a Governmental Entity, limited or general
partners or any other third party is necessary for the consummation by Purchaser
of the transactions contemplated thereby.

        3.4 LITIGATION. The is no suit, action, proceeding or investigation
pending, or to the best knowledge of Purchaser, threatened against or affecting
Purchaser or its properties, assets, operations or business which might delay or
prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby.

        3.5 BROKERAGE ARRANGEMENTS. Purchaser has not entered (directly or
indirectly) into any agreement with any person, firm or corporation that would
obligate Seller to pay any commission, brokerage or "finder's fee" or any fee
whatsoever in connection with the transactions contemplated herein.

        3.6 SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE. Solely for Seller's compliance with
federal and state securities laws and without limiting or affecting the other
representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of Seller hereunder, each
Purchaser further represents and warrants as follows:

        (i)    Purchaser has received from Seller and has had access to
               such information including, but not limited to,
               information with respect to the entities to be purchased
               under the Catalyst Purchase Agreement and information
               with respect to the Loan Agreement with Comerica Bank-
               Texas, as it deems necessary for the purchase of the
               Securities, as applicable, and has had, to the best of
               its knowledge, full access to all other information of
               Seller requested by Purchaser;

        (ii)   Purchaser understands that the sale of the Securities, as
               applicable, hereunder is intended to be exempt from registration
               under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act");

        (iii)  Purchaser acknowledges that all documents, records, and books
               pertaining to Seller, to the entities to be purchased pursuant

               with Comerica Bank-Texas have been made available for inspection
               by it and its attorneys, accountants or other representatives;

        (iv)   Purchaser or its advisor(s) have had a reasonable opportunity to
               ask questions of and receive answers from a person or persons
               acting on behalf of Seller concerning the sale of the Securities
               hereunder and all such questions have been answered to the
               satisfaction of Purchaser;

        (v)    Purchaser will not sell or otherwise transfer the
               Securities, as applicable, issued hereunder without
               registration of such securities under the Act or an
               exemption therefrom, and fully understands and agrees
               that Purchaser must bear the economic risk of its
               purchase for an indefinite period of time because, among
               other reasons, the Securities to be issued hereunder have
               not been registered under the Act or under the securities
               laws of certain states and, therefore, cannot be resold,
               pledged, assigned or otherwise disposed of unless the

               the applicable securities laws of such states or unless an
               exemption from such registration is available in the opinion of
               counsel for the holder, which counsel and opinion are reasonably
               satisfactory to Seller and its counsel. Purchaser represents that
               it is willing and able to bear the economic risk of its
               investment in the Securities issued hereunder, has no need for
               liquidity with respect thereto, is able to sustain a complete
               loss of its investment, and purchasing such Securities for its
               own account for investment and not a view to resale or
               distribution thereof except in compliance with the Act;

        (vi)   Purchaser is an accredited investor as such term is defined in
               Rule 501(a) of Regulation D promulgated under the Act;

        (vii)  Purchaser has such knowledge and experience in business and
               financial matters as to be capable of evaluating the merits and
               risks to him of an investment in the Securities; and

        (viii) Purchaser is purchasing the Securities, as applicable, for its
               own account for investment and not with a view to, or for resale
               in connection with, any distribution thereof within the meaning
               of the Act.

title to such Shares free and clear of all liens, security interests, claims,
charges, encumbrances, rights, options to purchase, voting trusts or other

            Company or the Subsidiaries incurred any new or additional

            aggregate) greater than as reflected on the Balance Sheet;

on the Balance Sheet or reflected in the notes thereto, neither the Company nor
any of the Subsidiaries has any obligation or liability material to the Company
and the Subsidiaries, taken as a whole (whether accrued, absolute, contingent,
unliquidated or otherwise, whether due or to become due), other than (i)
contractual liabilities incurred in the ordinary course of business which are
not required to be disclosed on the Financial Statements and (ii) liabilities
which have arisen after the Balance Sheet Date in the ordinary course of
business, consistent with past practices, and are set forth on Schedule 4.9 to
the extent that any such single contractual liability or other liability
involves $25,000 or more individually. It is agreed and understood by each
Selling Stockholder that this Section 4.9 does not negate or qualify in any
respect any other representation or warranty of the Selling Stockholders made in
this Agreement.

      4.10 TAXES. The financial and taxable results of operations of the Company
and the Subsidiaries have been reflected in the consolidated federal income tax
return of the affiliated group of corporations having the Company as its common
parent for the taxable year ended December 31, 1995. The Company and the
Subsidiaries have caused to be duly filed in a timely manner (taking into

and other governmental authorities all returns, information returns or

accepted accounting principles consistently applied for the payment of all Taxes
(including estimated Taxes) required with respect to the periods covered by such

                                    -12-

information developed and belonging to the Company and Subsidiaries which has
not been patented, to the best knowledge of the Selling Stockholders, has been

hereto sets forth a list and summary description of all fixed assets owned or

personal property leases, including those covering vehicles, where the annual
payment exceeds $5,000 or the remaining payment for the contract exceeds

on Schedule 4.13, all of the

                                    -13-

<PAGE>



Company's and the Subsidiaries' fixed assets are in good working order and
condition and fit for their intended purposes subject to the need for normal
repair and maintenance. Except as disclosed on Schedule 4.13, all leases of

and, to the best knowledge of the Selling Stockholders, none of the parties
thereto is in breach of any material provision thereof.

      4.14 OTHER ASSETS. Schedule 4.14 sets forth a list and summary description
of all properties and assets owned by the Company and the Subsidiaries
classified as "Other Assets" in the Financial Statements, and which have a net

since the Balance Sheet Date, neither the Company nor any of the Subsidiaries
has acquired or sold or otherwise disposed of any of such properties or assets
which, singularly or in the aggregate, are material to the operation of the
Company's or any of the Subsidiaries' businesses as presently constituted. Since
the Balance Sheet Date, the Company and the Subsidiaries have conducted their
business operations in a manner substantially the same as conducted by the
Company or the Subsidiaries immediately prior to the Balance Sheet Date.

      4.15  CONTRACTS AND AGREEMENTS; ADVERSE RESTRICTIONS.

            (a) Other than CDI equipment leases and master service agreements
entered into in the ordinary course of business, Schedule 4.15 sets forth a list
of all contracts, leases and agreements other than licenses and rights included
in Schedule 4.12 and leases included in Schedule 4.13, contracts and agreements
included in Schedule 4.19, any individual customer service agreements or
purchase orders which are subject to termination by the Company or any of the

providing for annual expenditures by, or revenues to, the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries of more than $20,000 to which the Company or any of the
Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any of its property is bound
(including, but not limited to, joint venture or partnership agreements,
contracts with any labor organizations, loan agreements, bonds, mortgages,
liens, pledges or other security agreements). All such contracts and agreements
included in Schedule 4.15 are in full force and effect and binding upon the
parties thereto and neither the Company nor, to the best knowledge of the
Selling Stockholders, any of the other parties thereto is in breach of any of
the material provisions thereof and, to the best knowledge of the Selling
Stockholders, no condition exists that with notice or lapse of time or both
would constitute a breach or default.

            (b) Except as set forth and identified in Schedules 4.9, 4.11, 4.12,
4.13, 4.15, 4.16, 4.17 or 4.19, neither the Company nor either of the
Subsidiaries is a party to any contract, lease, agreement or other commitment or
instrument or subject to any charter or other corporate restriction or subject
to any restriction or condition contained in any permit, license, judgment,
order, writ, injunction, decree or award which, singularly or in the aggregate,
materially and adversely affects

                                    -14-

<PAGE>



or is likely to materially and adversely affect the current existing business,
operations, properties, assets or condition (financial or otherwise) of the
Company and the Subsidiaries taken as a whole.

      4.16  TITLE AND LIENS.

            (a) The Company and the Subsidiaries have good and indefeasible
title to all properties, contracts, assets and leasehold estates, real and
personal, owned and used in their respective businesses, including, without
limitation, those reflected in the Schedules attached hereto, subject to no
mortgage, pledge, lien, conditional sales agreement, encumbrance, charge,
easement, right-of-way, encroachment, protrusion and other similar restrictions
(collectively, "Encumbrances"), except for Encumbrances listed in Schedule 4.16
and Permitted Encumbrances. Neither the Company nor either of the Subsidiaries
own any real property. Without limitation to the foregoing, except as set forth
on Schedule 4.16, no Landlord has placed an Encumbrance on the Landlord's
interest in such Landlord's Real Property Lease which would have priority over
the leasehold estate created by such Real Property Lease.

            (b) Without limiting the foregoing, the condition of title to or
interest in the Company's and the Subsidiaries' Leased Real Property is as
follows: to the best knowledge of the Selling Stockholders, except as set forth
in Schedules 4.13, 4.15 or 4.16, there are no leases, tenancy agreements,
easements, covenants, restrictions or any other instruments, agreements or
arrangements which create in or confer on any party other than the Company or
the Subsidiaries the right to occupy or possess all or any portion of the Leased
Real Property or create in or confer on any such party any right, title or
interest in or to the Leased Real Property or any portion thereof or any
interest therein; no party other than the Company or the Subsidiaries occupies
or possesses the Leased Real Property or any portion thereof; to the best
knowledge of the Selling Stockholders, there is legal and adequate ingress and
egress between each tract of Leased Real Property and an adjacent (or, if none,
the closest) public roadway; to the best knowledge of the Selling Stockholders,
the Leased Real Property is properly zoned in order to allow its current use in
the Company's and the Subsidiaries' businesses; no condemnation proceedings are
pending or, to the best knowledge of the Selling Stockholders, threatened that
could adversely affect the Leased Real Property and there are no claims or
demands pending or, to the best knowledge of the Selling Stockholders,
threatened by any party against the Leased Real Property which, if valid, would
create in, or confer on, any party other than the Company or the Subsidiaries,
any right, title or interest in or to the Leased Real Property or any portion
thereof.

            (c) Except as identified on Schedule 4.16, true, complete and
accurate copies of the Real Property Leases, have been made available to
Purchaser, and each of such leases is in full force and effect, to the best
knowledge of the Selling Stockholders, without modification or amendment from
the form delivered. Each such lease constitutes the legal, valid and binding

                                    -15-

<PAGE>



obligation of the Company and/or the Subsidiaries, as applicable, and, to the
best knowledge of the Selling Stockholders, the other respective parties
thereto. There exists no event or condition which, with notice or lapse of time,
or both, would constitute a default by the Company or either of the
Subsidiaries. All rentals and other payments due under such leases have been
paid in full and the Company and the Subsidiaries have performed all obligations
required to be performed by them thereunder and Schedule 4.16 sets forth a true
and accurate list of the rentals and other sums payable under the Real Property
Leases. No option has been exercised under any of such leases except options
whose exercise has been evidenced by a written document, a true, complete and
accurate copy of which has been made available to Purchaser with the
corresponding lease. Except as identified on Schedule 4.16, none of the leases
require the consent or approval of the other party to the lease in connection
with a transfer of control of the Company or the granting of a lien thereon or
security interest therein by Purchaser upon the transfer of control of the
Company to Purchaser. Neither the Company nor either of the Subsidiaries nor, to
the Selling Stockholders' best knowledge, any of the other parties to the
leases, is in default under any of the leases, which default would give either
party thereto the right to terminate such lease or give rise to the right on the
part of either party to any penalty or set-off.

      4.17 INSURANCE. The Company and the Subsidiaries maintain such policies of
casualty, liability and other insurance as they have determined to be
appropriate under the circumstances. Such policies, with respect to their
amounts and types of coverage, are considered by management of the Company and
the Subsidiaries to be adequate to insure against risks to which the Company and
the Subsidiaries are exposed in the ordinary course of business. Schedule 4.17
accurately identifies the types and coverage amounts of such insurance coverage.

      4.18 PERSONNEL. Schedule 4.18 sets forth a list of all officers,
directors, employees, and consultants and agents with whom the Company or any of
the Subsidiaries have agreements not terminable at the will of the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries (by type or classification) and their respective rates
of compensation (including the portions thereof attributable to bonuses),
including any other salary, bonus or other payment arrangement made with any of
them.

      4.19  BENEFIT PLANS AND LABOR MATTERS.

            (a) Schedule 4.19 sets forth a list (copies or descriptions of which
have been made available to the Purchaser) of all of the following agreements or
plans of the Company, any Subsidiary or any other entity which, together with
the Company or any Subsidiary, constitutes a single employer within the meaning
of Section 414 of the Code (hereinafter collectively referred to as the "Company
Group") which are presently in effect or which have been in effect at any time
during the two years prior to the Closing Date, or, in the case of documents
referred to in subparts (ii) below, have been in effect at any time prior to the
date hereof:

                                    -16-

<PAGE>



      (i)   union, collective bargaining, or similar agreements;

      (ii)  "employee welfare benefit plans" and "employee pension benefit
            plans," as defined in Sections 3(1) and 3(2) of ERISA; and

      (iii) any other pension, profit sharing, retirement, deferred
            compensation, stock purchase, stock option, incentive, bonus,
            vacation, severance, disability, health, hospitalization, medical,
            life insurance, vision, dental, prescription drug, supplemental
            unemployment, layoff, automobile, apprenticeship and training, day
            care, scholarship, group legal benefits, fringe benefit, or other
            employee benefit plan, program, policy, or arrangement, whether
            written or unwritten, formal or informal, which any member of the
            Company Group maintains or to which any member of the Company Group
            has any outstanding, present, or future obligation to contribute to
            or make payments under, whether voluntary, contingent, or otherwise
            (the plans, programs, policies, or arrangements described in
            subparts (ii) or (iii) as herein collectively referred to as the
            "Company Plans").

      (iv)  the Selling Stockholders have delivered to the Purchaser a copy of
            all 1994 and 1995 governmental filings, Internal Revenue Service
            determination letters, financial statements, and actuarial reports,
            including but not limited to, the most recent financial statements
            of each Qualified Plan, the most recent actuarial report, if any,
            for each employee pension benefit plan and Internal Revenue Service
            Forms 5500 for each Company Plan for the relevant plan years of 1994
            and 1995. All financial statements and actuarial reports have been
            prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
            and actuarial principles, applied on a uniform and consistent basis.

          (b) Schedule 4.19 identifies each of the Company Plans which are
Qualified Plans. A copy of all determinations by the Internal Revenue Service
respecting the Qualified Plans have been delivered to the Purchaser. All of such
determination letters remain in effect and have not been revoked. No Qualified
Plan has been amended in any material respect since the issuance of the most
recent determination letter. No issue concerning qualification of any Qualified
Plan is pending before or, to the best knowledge and belief of the Selling
Stockholders, threatened by the Internal Revenue Service. Each Qualified Plan
has been administered according to its terms, except for those terms which are
inconsistent with the changes required by statutes, regulations, and rulings for
which changes are not yet required to be made, in which case each Qualified Plan
has been administered in accordance with the provisions of the statutes,
regulations, and rulings, and no member of the Company Group nor any fiduciary
of any Qualified Plan has done anything which would adversely affect the
qualified status of any Qualified Plan or any related trust. To the best
knowledge of the

                                    -17-

<PAGE>



Selling Stockholders, each Qualified Plan currently complies with the
requirements under Section 401(a) of the Code and, if applicable Section 401(k)
of the Code, other than changes required by statutes, regulations, and rulings
for which amendments are not yet required.

          (c) To the best knowledge of the Selling Stockholders, each member of
the Company Group is in compliance with the requirements prescribed by any and
all statutes, orders, governmental rules, and regulations applicable to the
Company Plans and all reports and disclosures relating to the Company Plans
required to be filed with or furnished to governmental agencies, participants or
beneficiaries prior to the Closing Date have been or will be filed or furnished
in a timely manner and in accordance with applicable law.

          (d) Except as listed in Schedule 4.19, no termination or partial
termination of any existing Company Plan has occurred, nor has a notice of
intent to terminate any existing Company Plan been issued by a member of the
Company Group. The Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation has not instituted, and,
to the best knowledge of the Selling Stockholders, is not expected to institute,
any proceedings to terminate any Company Plan. To the best knowledge of the
Selling Stockholders, each employee pension benefit plan listed as terminated in
Schedule 4.19 has met the requirements for standard termination of
single-employer plans contained in Section 4041(b) of ERISA.

          (e) No Company Plan has suffered any "accumulated funding deficiency,"
within the meaning of ERISA Section 302 and Section 412 of the Code, whether or
not waived, and if any Company Plan were terminated on the Closing Date, no
member of the Company Group would have any liability to any participants or

    5.5 BROKERAGE ARRANGEMENTS. The Purchaser has not entered (directly or
indirectly) into any agreement with any person, firm or corporation that would
obligate the Selling Stockholders to pay any commission, brokerage or "finder's
fee" or any fee whatsoever in connection with the transactions contemplated
herein.

    5.6 SECURITIES LAW COMPLIANCE. Solely for the Selling Stockholders'
compliance with federal and state securities laws and without limiting or
affecting the other representations, warranties, covenants or agreements of the
Selling Stockholders hereunder, the Purchaser further represents and warrants as
follows:

      (i)   The Purchaser has received from the Selling Stockholders and has had
            access to such information as it deems necessary for the purchase of
            the Shares, and has had, to the best of its knowledge, full access
            to all other information of the Company requested by the Purchaser;

      (ii)  The Purchaser understands that the sale of the Shares hereunder is
            intended to be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of
            1933 (the "Act");

      (iii) The Purchaser acknowledges that all documents, records, and books

            Purchaser must bear the economic risk of its purchase for an
            indefinite period of time because, among other reasons, the Shares
            to be transferred hereunder have not been registered under the Act
            or under the securities laws of certain states and, therefore,
            cannot be resold, pledged, assigned or otherwise disposed of unless
            the Shares are subsequently registered under the Act and under the
            applicable securities laws of such states or unless an exemption
            from such registration is available in the opinion of counsel for
            the holder, which counsel and opinion are reasonably satisfactory to
            the Company and its counsel. The Purchaser represents that it is
            willing and able to bear the economic risk of its investment in the
            Shares issued hereunder, has no need for liquidity with respect
            thereto, is able to sustain a complete

materials and operating data and information available as of the date hereof and

there is a change in any state of facts, or there is the occurrence,
nonoccurrence or existence of any event subsequent to the date of this
Agreement, which change or event is known to the Selling Stockholders and which
would make any representation and warranty (including the information set forth
in the Schedules) made by the Selling Stockholders to the Purchaser not true or
correct in any material respect, it being the intention of the parties to this
Agreement that the Selling Stockholders shall engage in a continuous disclosure
process from the date of this Agreement through the Closing Date.

                                 ARTICLE VIII
                        EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS

    8.1 STATUS OF EMPLOYEES. Except for such employees covered by employment
agreements listed in Schedule 4.18, (a) neither the Purchaser, the Company nor
any of the Subsidiaries shall have any obligation to continue the employment of
any employee of the Company or any of the Subsidiaries after the Closing Date,
and (b) after the Closing Date any continued employment of the employees of the
Company or the Subsidiaries shall be on such terms and conditions and include

                                  ARTICLE IX
                           TERMINATION AND SURVIVAL

    9.1 EVENTS OF TERMINATION. Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, this
Agreement shall terminate upon the occurrence of any of the following events:

                                    -39-

<PAGE>



          (a)   the written consent of the Representative and the Purchaser;

          (b) by written notice of the Purchaser or the Representative, without
prejudice to other rights and remedies which the terminating party may have
(provided the terminating party is not otherwise in material default or breach
of this Agreement, or has failed or refused to close without justification
hereunder), if the Purchaser or any of the Selling Stockholders, as applicable,
shall (i) materially fail or have failed to perform the covenants or agreements
required to be performed prior to the Closing Date by such party hereunder, or
(ii) materially breach or have breached any of its representations or warranties
contained herein;

          (c) by either the Representative or the Purchaser in writing, without
liability, if there shall be any order, writ, injunction or decree of any court
or governmental or regulatory agency binding on Purchaser or any Selling
Stockholder, which prohibits or restrains Purchaser or any Selling Stockholder
from consummating the transactions contemplated hereby, provided that Purchaser
and Selling Stockholders shall have used their best efforts to have any such
order, writ, injunction or decree lifted and the same shall not have been lifted
within 30 days after entry by any such court or governmental or regulatory
agency; or

          (d) the written notice by the Purchaser or the Representative on or
after December 4, 1996 if the Closing has not occurred by such date due to the
failure of any condition to Closing in Section 7.1 or 7.2 hereof not due to a
breach or default of a party hereto, provided that as of such date neither the
Purchaser nor any of the Selling Stockholders is in default or that both the
Purchaser and one or more of the Selling Stockholders are in default under this
Agreement.

      9.2 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. The following provisions shall apply in the
event of a termination of this Agreement:

          (a) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Representative
pursuant to Section 9.1(b), the Representative shall be entitled to retain the
Prepayment on behalf of the Selling Stockholders and the Representative shall
distribute the Prepayment to the Selling Stockholders, in the applicable pro
rata portions or to the Company, as agreed by the Representative and the Selling
Stockholders. Purchaser and the Selling Stockholders hereby agree in the case of
this clause (a) of Section 9.2 that (i) the Selling Stockholders' damages for
Purchaser's default are difficult or impossible to determine, (ii) Purchaser's
payment of the Prepayment is deemed a reasonable estimate of the Selling
Stockholders' potential damages, (iii) such payment is not a penalty or
forfeiture, and (iv) upon the Representative's retention of the Prepayment on
behalf of the Selling Stockholders, neither the Purchaser nor any Selling
Stockholders shall have any further liability or obligation to one another in
connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated hereby except
as otherwise provided in the Confidentiality Agreement.

                                    -40-

<PAGE>



          (b) In the event this Agreement is terminated by the Purchaser
pursuant to Section 9.1(b) or by any party pursuant to Section 9.1(a), 9.1(c) or
9.1(d) or for failure of either of the conditions to Closing of Purchaser set
forth in Sections 7.1(j) and 7.1(m) hereof, the Prepayment shall be promptly
returned by the Representative to the Purchaser.

          (c) Solely for purposes of determining whether termination of this
Agreement is permissible by any party pursuant to Section 9.1(b), material
failure to perform the covenants or agreements required to be performed by the
Selling Stockholders or the Purchaser prior to the Closing Date or material
breach of any representations or warranties shall be deemed to exist if such
failure to perform and/or breach may reasonably be expected to result in
monetary damages in the aggregate to the Purchaser or the Selling Stockholders
in excess of $150,000.

          (d) If this Agreement is terminated by the Representative or by the
Purchaser as permitted under Section 9.1 and not as the result of the failure of
any party to perform its obligations hereunder, such termination shall be
without liability to any party to this Agreement or any stockholder, director,
officer, employee, agent or representative of such party.

          (e) The Purchaser and the Selling Stockholders acknowledge that the
Shares are not readily available in the open market and the assets of the
Company and the Subsidiaries are unique and specifically identifiable.
Accordingly, the Purchaser and the Selling Stockholders further agree and
stipulate that if the Closing does not occur because of the failure of any
Selling Stockholder to perform its obligations hereunder, (i) monetary damages
and any other remedy at law will not be adequate, (ii) the Purchaser shall be
entitled to specific performance as the remedy for such breach, (iii) each party
hereto agrees to waive any objection to the remedy of specific performance, (iv)
each party agrees that the granting of specific performance by any court will
not be deemed to be harsh or oppressive to the party who is ordered specifically
to perform its obligations under this Agreement, and (v) in connection with any
action for specific performance that meets the foregoing criteria, the Purchaser
shall be entitled to reasonable attorneys' fees and other costs of prosecuting
or defending such action.

          (f) The right to seek specific performance hereunder shall not
preclude the Purchaser from seeking any other remedy at law or in equity for a
breach of any obligation, representation, warranty, covenant or agreement by any
Selling Stockholder hereunder.

    9.3 SURVIVAL. The liability of the Selling Stockholders for the breach of
any of the representations and warranties of the Selling Stockholders set forth
in Article IV shall be limited to claims for which the Purchaser delivers
written notice to the Selling Stockholders within 16 months after the Closing
Date. The liability of the Purchaser for the breach of any of the
representations and warranties of the Purchaser set forth in Article V shall be
limited to claims for which Selling

                                    -41-

<PAGE>



Stockholders shall deliver written notice to the Purchaser within 16 months
after the Closing Date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the survival period for
the representations and warranties in Sections 4.2 and 4.10 shall be the
applicable statute of limitations.


                                   ARTICLE X
                                INDEMNIFICATION

    10.1 INDEMNIFICATION OF THE SELLING STOCKHOLDERS. The Purchaser, from and
after the Closing Date, shall indemnify and hold the Selling Stockholders
harmless from and against any and all Damages suffered by Selling Stockholders
as a result of, caused by, arising out of, or in any way relating to any
misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or nonfulfillment of any agreement or
covenant on the part of the Purchaser under this Agreement or any
misrepresentation in or omission from any list, schedule, certificate, or other
instrument furnished or to be furnished to the Selling Stockholders by the
Purchaser pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

    10.2 INDEMNIFICATION OF THE PURCHASER. The Selling Stockholders, severally
but not jointly, and on the basis of the Seller Percentages shall indemnify and
hold the Company, the Subsidiaries and the Purchaser harmless from and against
any and all Damages suffered by the Company, any of the Subsidiaries or the
Purchaser as a result of, caused by, arising out of, or in any way relating to
any misrepresentation, breach of warranty, or nonfulfillment of any agreement or
covenant on the part of the Selling Stockholders under this Agreement or any
misrepresentation in or omission from any list, schedule, certificate, or other
instrument furnished or to be furnished to the Purchaser by the Selling
Stockholders, the Company or any of the Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement.

    10.3 DEMANDS. Each indemnified party hereunder agrees that promptly upon its
discovery of facts giving rise to a claim for indemnity under the provisions of
this Agreement, including receipt by it of notice of any demand, assertion,
claim, action or proceeding, judicial or otherwise, by any third party (such
third party actions being collectively referred to herein as the "Claim"), with
respect to any matter as to which it claims to be entitled to indemnity under
the provisions of this Agreement, it will give prompt notice thereof in writing
to the indemnifying party, together with a statement of such information
respecting any of the foregoing as it shall have. Such notice shall include a
formal demand for indemnification under this Agreement. The indemnifying party
shall not be obligated to indemnify the indemnified party with respect to any
Claim if the indemnified party knowingly failed to notify the indemnifying party
thereof in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement in sufficient time
to permit the indemnifying party or its counsel to defend against such matter
and to make a timely response thereto including, without limitation, any
responsive motion or answer to a complaint, petition, notice or other legal,
equitable or administrative process

                                    -42-

<PAGE>



relating to the Claim, only insofar as such knowing failure to notify the
indemnifying party has actually resulted in prejudice or damage to the
indemnifying party.

    10.4 RIGHT TO CONTEST AND DEFEND. The indemnifying party shall be entitled
at its cost and expense to contest and defend by all appropriate legal
proceedings any Claim with respect to which it is called upon to indemnify the
indemnified party under the provisions of this Agreement; provided, that notice
of the intention so to contest shall be delivered by the indemnifying party to
the indemnified party within 20 days from the date of receipt by the
indemnifying party of notice by the indemnified party of the assertion of the
Claim. Any such contest may be conducted in the name and on behalf of the
indemnifying party or the indemnified party as may be appropriate. Such contest
shall be conducted by reputable counsel employed by the indemnifying party, but
the indemnified party shall have the right but not the obligation to participate
in such proceedings and to be represented by counsel of its own choosing at its
sole cost and expense. The indemnifying party shall have full authority to
determine all action to be taken with respect thereto; provided, however, that
the indemnifying party will not have the authority to subject the indemnified
party to any obligation whatsoever, other than the performance of purely
ministerial tasks or obligations not involving material expense. If the
indemnifying party does not elect to contest any such Claim, the indemnifying
party shall be bound by the result obtained with respect thereto by the
indemnified party. At any time after the commencement of the defense of any
Claim, the indemnifying party may request the indemnified party to agree in
writing to the abandonment of such contest or to the payment or compromise by
the indemnified party of the asserted Claim, whereupon such action shall be
taken unless the indemnified party determines that the contest should be
continued, and so notifies the indemnifying party in writing within 15 days of
such request from the indemnifying party. If the indemnified party determines
that the contest should be continued, the indemnifying party shall be liable
hereunder only to the extent of the amount that the other party to the contested
Claim had agreed unconditionally to accept in payment or compromise as of the
time the indemnifying party made its request therefor to the indemnified party.

    10.5 COOPERATION. If requested by the indemnifying party, the indemnified
party agrees to cooperate with the indemnifying party and its counsel in
contesting any Claim that the indemnifying party elects to contest or, if
appropriate, in making any counterclaim against the person asserting the Claim,
or any cross-complaint against any person, and the indemnifying party will
reimburse the indemnified party for any expenses incurred by it in so
cooperating. At no cost or expense to the indemnified party, the indemnifying
party shall cooperate with the indemnified party and its counsel in contesting
any Claim.

      10.6 RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE. The indemnified party agrees to afford the
indemnifying party and its counsel the opportunity to be present at, and to
participate in, conferences with all persons,

                                    -43-

<PAGE>



including governmental authorities, asserting any Claim against the indemnified
party or conferences with representatives of or counsel for such persons.

    10.7 PAYMENT OF DAMAGES. The indemnifying party shall pay to the indemnified
party in immediately available funds any amounts to which the indemnified party
may become entitled by reason of the provisions of this Agreement, such payment
to be made within five days after any such amounts are finally determined either
by mutual agreement of the parties hereto or pursuant to the final
non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. In calculating any
amount to be paid by an indemnifying party by reason of the provisions of this
Agreement, the amount shall be reduced by all tax benefits and other
reimbursements credited to or received by the other party related to the
Damages.

    10.8 LIMITATIONS ON INDEMNIFICATION. The Selling Stockholders and the
Purchaser shall not be liable for Damages under Section 10.2 or 10.1,
respectively, unless the aggregate amount of Damages for which the indemnifying
party would, but for the provisions of this Section 10.8, be liable exceeds, on
an aggregate basis, $50,000 at which time the indemnifying party's
indemnification obligation shall be for the entire amount in excess of $50,000;
provided, however, that such $50,000 threshold amount shall not limit any
party's liability for a knowing and intended breach of a representation,
warranty or covenant of such party hereunder. In addition, the liability of each
of the Selling Stockholders for the breach of its representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements hereunder shall be limited to the Selling Stockholder's
portion of the first $2,500,000 of the total of the Cash Consideration and
Prepayment received by such Selling Stockholder under this Agreement determined
on the basis of the Seller Percentages, respectfully, of the Selling
Stockholders; provided, however, that the liability of a Selling Stockholder for
the breach of any representations and warranties in Section 4.10 of this
Agreement shall be limited to such Selling Stockholder's portion of the total
Cash Consideration and Prepayment paid by the Purchaser less any other
indemnification payments that do not relate to Section 4.10. The liability of
the Purchaser for breach of its representations, warranties, covenants and
agreements hereunder shall be limited to $2,500,000.


                                  ARTICLE XI
                                   MEDIATION

    11.1 DIRECT NEGOTIATION. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this
Agreement, the parties to this Agreement (for purposes of this Article XI, the
"Party" or "Parties") agree to the prompt and equitable settlement of all
controversies or claims (a "dispute") between or among the Parties only (and not
involving third parties) including but not limited to those arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or any related agreements or instruments ("Subject
Documents"), including any claim

                                    -44-

<PAGE>



based on or arising from an alleged tort, through either negotiation, mediation
or binding arbitration as set forth in this Article XI. The Parties agree to
negotiate their differences directly and in good faith for a period of no less
than thirty days after receiving written notification of the existence of a
dispute.

    11.2 MEDIATOR. If a dispute involving only parties to this Agreement is not
resolved within thirty days after written notification of the existence of a
dispute, the Parties agree to submit their dispute to a mediator to work with
them to resolve their differences. The Parties hereto agree that at any time a
dispute is to be mediated under this Agreement, the Parties will either agree
upon a mediator to mediate the dispute or pick one in a blind drawing from a
list of names of experienced mediators compiled by each Party submitting one
such name, and the mediator whose name is drawn will mediate the dispute. The
Parties shall notify the selected mediator in writing of the existence of a
dispute and the selected mediator shall have thirty days from receipt of the
notification to meet with the Parties in an effort to help them resolve the
dispute, unless the Parties mutually consent to an extension of such deadline.
If the originally selected mediator is unable or unwilling to begin or continue
to act as the selected mediator, or if the Parties mutually agree to replace the
original or any subsequently selected mediator, a successor mediator shall be
selected by mutual agreement in the manner set forth above or, if the Parties
agree, by another method. If the Parties are unable to agree on a successor
mediator, the chief judge of the federal district courts for the Southern
District of Texas, Houston Division, shall select a mediator who may be rejected
by the Parties only for bias.

      11.3 MEDIATION PROCEDURE. The mediation shall be conducted pursuant to the
rules generally used by the mediator in the mediator's practice, subject to the
following:

          (a) The mediator shall act as an advocate for resolution and shall use
his or her best efforts to assist the Parties in reaching a mutually acceptable
settlement. The mediator may suggest ways of resolving the dispute, but may not
impose his or her own judgment on the issues and that of the Parties. The
mediator shall not have the authority to decide any issue for the Parties, but
will attempt to facilitate the voluntary resolution of the dispute by the
Parties.

          (b) Each Party participating in the mediation shall have authority to
settle, and all persons necessary to the decision to settle shall be present
during the entire mediation session or sessions.

          (c) The mediation shall take place at a time and convenient location
agreeable to the mediator and the Parties, as the mediator shall determine.


                                    -45-

<PAGE>



          (d) Mediation sessions shall be private, and only the Parties and
their representatives may attend the mediation sessions. Other persons may
attend the mediation sessions only with the written permission of the Parties
and with the consent of the mediator.

          (e) There shall be no stenographic record of the mediation process,
and no person shall tape record any portion of the mediation sessions.

          (f) No subpoenas, summons, complaints, citations, writs, or other
process may be served at or away from the site of any mediation session upon any
person who then is entering, on the way to, in attendance at or leaving the
session.

          (g) The Parties shall participate in the mediation proceeding in good
faith with the intention to settle, if at all possible.

          (h) No later than three business days prior to the mediation, each
Party shall deliver to the mediator all information reasonably required for the
mediator to understand the issues presented and a confidential memorandum (not
to exceed five pages with normal type size and margins) setting forth the
following:

    (i)   identification of the matters in dispute;

    (ii)  concise statement of points (factual, legal, practical) that each
          Party believes enhances its chance of achieving a favorable outcome of
          the dispute; and

    (iii) history of settlement discussions and outstanding offers of settlement

The above rules may be amended with the consent of the Parties.

    11.4 RELEASE. The mediator shall not be a necessary or proper Party in
judicial proceedings relating to the mediation. Neither the mediator, the firm
employing the mediator, nor the organization providing the mediator shall be
liable to any Party for any acts or omissions in connection with any mediation
conducted pursuant to this Article XI.

    11.5 COMPROMISE NEGOTIATION. The mediation is a compromise negotiation for
purposes of Rule 408 of the Federal Rules of Evidence and Texas Rules of
Evidence and is an alternative dispute resolution procedure subject to Section
154.073 of the Texas Civil Practice & Remedies Code. The entire procedure is
confidential. All conduct, statements, promises, offers, views, and opinions,
whether oral or written, made in the course of the mediation by any of the
Parties, their agents, employees, or other representatives and by the mediator,
who is the Parties' joint agent for purposes

                                    -46-

<PAGE>



of these compromise negotiations, are confidential and shall, in addition where
appropriate, be deemed to be work product and privileged. Such conduct,
statements, promises, offers, views, and opinions shall not be discoverable or
admissible for any purposes, including impeachment, in any litigation or other
proceedings involving the Parties and shall not be disclosed to anyone not an
agent, employee, expert, or other representative for any of the Parties.
Evidence otherwise discoverable or admissible is not excluded from discovery or
admission as a result of its use in the mediation. Confidential information
disclosed to the mediator by the Parties or by witnesses in the course of the
mediation shall not be divulged by the mediator. All records, reports, or other
documents received by the mediator while serving in that capacity shall be
confidential. The mediator shall not be compelled to divulge such records or to
testify with regard to the mediation in any adversarial proceeding or judicial
forum.

    11.6 COSTS OF MEDIATION. The Parties shall bear their respective costs
incurred in connection with the mediation described in this Article XI, except
that the Parties shall share equally the fees and expenses of the mediator, the
costs of obtaining the facility for the mediation, and the fees and expenses of
any experts employed at the request of the mediator.

      11.7 TERMINATION OF MEDIATION. The mediation shall be terminated upon the
first to occur of the following:

          (a) the execution of a settlement agreement resolving the dispute by
the Parties;

          (b) a written declaration of the mediator to the effect that further
efforts at mediation are no longer worthwhile; or

          (c) after the completion of two full days of mediation sessions, by
written declaration of a Party or Parties to the effect that mediation
proceedings are terminated.

    11.8 MANDATORY BINDING ARBITRATION. In the event that such dispute is not
resolved through mediation as described above, then the Parties agree that such
dispute shall be determined by binding arbitration in accordance with the Texas
General Arbitration Act and the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
Arbitration Association ("AAA"). All statutes of limitations which would
otherwise be applicable shall apply to any arbitration proceeding under this
Section 11.8. Judgment upon the award rendered in such arbitration proceeding
may be entered in any court having jurisdiction. This section shall apply only
if, at the time of proposed submission to AAA, the Parties have first tried to
resolve such dispute through a non-binding mediation as provided above or have
mutually agreed in writing to waive the right to resolve such dispute through
mediation.


                                    -47-

<PAGE>



    11.9 INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement or this Article XI to the contrary, no Party hereto shall be precluded
from seeking injunctive relief or a temporary restraining order prior to
implementing procedures for mediation or arbitration hereunder provided that
such Party determines in the good faith exercise of its best judgment that any
Party hereto or the Company will suffer irreparable injury or harm by any delay
caused by mediation or arbitration proceedings.


                                  ARTICLE XII
                                 MISCELLANEOUS

either has paid any expenses arising out of the preparation, negotiation,
execution and consummation of this Agreement.
