is the beneficial owner of 1,642,503.5 shares of Common Stock (representing
7.8% of the  outstanding  Common Stock of the  Company)  through her power to
revoke the Revocable Trust  established by her under Trust Agreement dated
October 26, 1994 (the "Revocable Trust").  Such Common Stock was transferred by

shares  of  Common  Stock beneficially  owned by Ms.  Schein,  except that Ms.
Schein retains the right to vote the  shares  of  Common  Stock in  connection
with  (i) a  dissolution  or liquidation  of the Company,  (ii) a merger or
consolidation  of the Company or (iii) a sale,  lease or other  transfer of a
Significant  Business  Unit of the Company (as such term is defined in the HSI
Voting Trust Agreement),  and upon a revocation of the  Revocable  Trust,
would have such voting  power.  Unless and until Ms.  Schein  revokes the
Revocable  Trust,  the Trustees of the Revocable Trust, Irving Shafran and
Judith Shafran,  share the power to vote, or to direct the vote of,  the
shares  of  Common  Stock  described  in Item  5(a)  above in connection  with
(i) a dissolution or liquidation of the Company,  (ii) a merger or
consolidation  of the Company or (iii) a sale,  lease or other transfer of a
Significant Business Unit of the Company.

Ms.  Schein does not have the power to dispose of, or to direct the
disposition of, any of the shares of Common Stock owned by the Revocable
Trust,  other than through the right to revoke such trust.  Unless and until
Ms. Schein revokes the Revocable Trust, the Trustees of the Revocable Trust,
Irving Shafran and Judith Shafran,  share the power to dispose  of, or to
direct the  disposition  of, the shares of Common Stock described in Item 5(a)
above.

Ms. Schein is also party to the Amended and Restated HSI Agreement, effective
as of February 16, 1994 (the "HSI Agreement"), among the Company, Marvin H.

dated September 15, 1994,  Pamela Schein,  Pamela Joseph,  Martin Sperber,
Stanley M.  Bergman,  Steven  Paladino and James P.  Breslawski.  Although Ms.
Schein would, upon a revocation of the Revocable Trust,  have the sole power to
dispose of, or to direct the  disposition of, the shares of Common Stock
described in Item 5(a) above,  any  disposition of such shares may be made only
in accordance  with the terms and conditions of the HSI Agreement.

(c) The Trustees of the Revocable  Trust sold 715,000  shares of Common Stock
on June 20,  1996,  in  connection  with an  underwritten  public  offering  of

Item 6.  Contracts, Arrangements, Understandings or Relationships with Respect
to Securities of the Issuer

As discussed in Item 5 above, the shares of Common Stock  beneficially  owned
by Ms. Schein are held by the Revocable  Trust. The Trustees of the Revocable
Trust share  investment  power over the shares of Common Stock.  As also
described in Item 5, the shares of Common Stock  beneficially owned by Ms.
Schein are subject to the HSI Voting Trust Agreement,  which grants the Voting
Trustee the right to vote such shares  except in  connection  with  certain
extraordinary  corporate transactions.

the termination of the Voting Trust Agreement or January 1, 1999, Ms. Schein
has the right to  serve as or  designate  a  director  of the  Company.  Irving
Shafran presently  serves as Ms.  Schein's  designee  on the Board of
Directors  of the Company. The HSI Agreement also limits the right of Ms.
Schein to participate in any  solicitation of proxies or any election contest
and limits the right of the Company to adopt a shareholder rights plan.

Additionally,  Marvin  Schein has agreed to consult with Ms. Schein prior to
the exercise  of  certain  of his  rights of  approval  and  consent  under
various agreements  executed in  connection  with the  reorganization  of the
Company in September 1994.
